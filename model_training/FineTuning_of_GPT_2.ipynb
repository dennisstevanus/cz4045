They were obviously not aware that they could terminate a customer for no reason. Seriously? How is this ever considered a free trial?!

However, as I've already seen countless times, the guy who is assistant to speak is not friendly. He spoke in a very cryptic manner to me after I had finished signing up, and I asked what was going on. He said he was trying to sort out a problem with my account, that I was not aware that someone else was aware that I was using their account. I explained that I was unaware that someone else was using my account, and he continued to say it wasn't a problem at all. He continued to say I had to sign out and that I could go through it. I asked him what he meant by that and he said he meant I could go through it. i. DEPICT me. his tone of voice became even more accusatory. I asked what he meant if I meant that if I wanted to watch a movie that person else has made through a different website I should at least sign out and that I should at this point be concerned that someone else is using my account? He continued to say I had to ask for a refund. and that I needed to contact the bank. i. LEAVE. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that I couldn’t and there was no such thing. I had been warned that if I refused I would be referred to a manager. I was refused again and this time I was told that they had to stay away from the store I was in. A store they don’t want to lose customers, they want the customer to click the 'back button' and return to their app. A company this size doesn’t understand the customer and their primary concern is losing customers. I have canceled my account and returned to my partner to cancel my debit card. All I was asked to do was return my device to the shipping address I had it shipped to and they would only refund the shipping address. I just finished paying for another device and this time I was asked to cancel my account as I didn’t know what to say. I don’t blame them. I don’t ever. I am ready to try another device and pay for by this time next month I will just buy another device. They are thieves.. I pay for nothing but good things. Not stealing. Not making money out of nothing.. just making money. You can laugh, you can regret, you can be bitter, you can even be very positive when you are not at all positive. There are so many great things out there that are not stealing and that is a shame. Hopefully I did not caught you all, and I will share my experiences and suggestions for people who not only are not working but are instead living on a trust fund go fund something great.<|endoftext|>\n",

If Netflix really wants to ensure 100% customer service, it must provide it's customers with the most up to date information.If they do not want their customers doing the walking walking, then I don't think they deserve a service like this. They need to rethink their customer service and their customer service is far better than this. As for the remaining charge...I do not think they want to produce new series or tell customers what to do instead they choose to raise the price and more misleading people.I do not think they consider this charge a good measure and if they did, they would implement a price cut.As for the remaining charge...I do not think I have a problem with this level of misleading advertising and I for one don't think I will support a price cut.

It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n",

I don't have a huge library at home, but I do have plenty of material for Netflix. The only thing I don't like is how Netflix makes recommendations for you, instead of just giving you the link to the stuff you found and if it's not there just sort it by yourself. That's pretty poor and takes away from the variety you get from these sites. I still love it and definitely recommend it.\n",

I just binge watch everything i can get my hands on.  I love that I can watch everything in high quality.  I think Netflix is the best streaming service out there.
