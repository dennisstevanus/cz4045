CZ4045 Assignment 1
===================

In this github repository there are 3 different section.
1. Domain Specific Dataset Analysis
2. Development of a (Noun - Adjective) Pair Ranker
3. Application for the (Noun - Adjective) Pair Ranker

Before starting for the each specific section, let's see how to install the required library used in this Project.
