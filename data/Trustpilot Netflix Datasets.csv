"Netflix is basically turned into this:- Very little good stuff (you can only watch it so many times) - somewhat decent amount of mediocre stuff that gets boring quick. - A LOT of Garbage and LOW tier movies and shows all rotten (rotten tomatoes) but also in general very poor selection. They raised there prices slightly because they were supposedly going to add more content and expand there selection. But that was a nice joke üòÇ. Netflix really needs to step up there game, Crave/ HBO is crushing them with quality."
"As a fan of car shows and motoring related content I have found the content displayed on Netflix quite amusing. A great way to pass time."
"I really enjoy Netflix. Amazing contents. It has many great content. Loved it."
"Satisfactory no more than that to be honest not fantastic that they‚Äôre charging more for better quality and more devices for downloads but there isn‚Äôt enough good content a lot of it is budget stuff that is cheap old and no one wants to watch yes there is some good stuff but it is minimal. I‚Äôm going to try Amazon Prime Video instead and see if that‚Äôs any better probably not knowing these companies."
"Sick of companies getting political and trying to influence their customers. Stay out of elections and stick to your business!"
"The new profile level PIN system to access Netflix was imposed without our knowledge or consent. There's no reverting to the previous account level PIN system (to restrict access to mature content).It seems that as we were unaware of this change, any device that had signed out and then back in had no PIN restrictions applied - which is concern as children were using my account.The new system is less flexible - you're no longer able to watch specific programs with a higher maturity level  by using a PIN (unless you allow someone to access a different profile by giving them the PIN to that profile - but then their programs will show up in your profile and once in that profile they can watch what they want!).  This is a poorly planned and executed ""update"". Not helped by 2 out of 3 customer support enquiries giving wrong or confusing information when I contact them.There's no way to contact, complain to or feedback to Netflix on this issue but I suspect the frustrations this causes will result in another change to the system at some point. Hopefully they will learn from this and carry it out more effectively (perhaps some customer feedback and a beta test??).Simon"
"I really enjoy Netflix. It has some great content and I get along well with the mobile app. The only problem I have with Netflix is that the UK have a very limited selection compared to the USA version."
"Utter rubbish now. Politically-correct agenda in EVERY Netflix own production. Propaganda forced down people‚Äôs throats all the time (whilst charging them for it...) with over-representation of a certain social group which is presented as being ‚Äònormal‚Äô. I cancelled my membership. There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre getting my money for that sort of thing.You‚Äôll soon realise what I mean by ‚Äúpolitically-correct agenda‚Äù and ‚Äúover-representation‚Äù if you watch any of the recent Netflix Original productions. I originally posted a less vague review which was cancelled by Trustpilot despite not being in the least bit offensive.  Just watch any Netflix Original and you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm referring to."
"Been using their service for along time now had a wide variety of shows"
"If I could select below 1 I would. Asked to raise a complaint over being billed 4 times extra I was met with the response ‚Äúwe will not be having that‚Äù"
"Poor customer service! Unhelpful and rude,  couldn‚Äôt even provide me with complaints email."
"I spoke with a customer support specialist today about a year long issue and was told that it was basically my fault for thinking that the previous Netflix customer service representative did their job. I called in a year ago to let them know that I suspected fraud and was told either change your password or cancel the account and open a new account. I chose to cancel the account and open a new account with payment through another source. Fast forward a year. They have been billing me through two accounts and told me since I didn't finish the cancellation process, I was just paying for someone to watch Netflix for free, for a year. Question: If you already suspected fraud on your account, would you be willing to give anyone your account number? Well, because I didn't do that and trusted that the customer support person would cancel my account. I have paid almost $200 for a hacker to have free Netflix for a year. That's not the icing on the cake. Then, the representative from today says, ""By the way, there is no way someone can get your information to get into your account."" Yeah, right. She clearly told me that the account was being used and that the user was in another country. Yeah, I don't have friends in Asia Boo! It gets better! They told me that they could only reimburse me for one of the twelve months. Buyer beware! Hopefully, your account never gets hacked! It is more common than Netflix leads people to believe....."
"A load of garbage but with the odd good drama.No effort to improve user experience, no one click to pick up where you left off, just another rubbish company with enough money not to care"
"i just hate them. promote propaganda."
"The overall design is a little wonky. All they do is cancel my favorite new shows only after a month of them premiering and keep shi* like cuties that no one wants to watch rather then it removed."
"Netflix is great.. They should stop making seasons of shows with open ends though, they keep canning them."
"Thought I would use their 'on line chat' to get more info about their on line offer of 50% off for 1st two months for new members. I spoke to 'Aleisha' who started by asking for my name and email - no problem there. Then she said 'Dont use backspace & respond in a timely manner' - I may be old fashioned but where did the please & thank you go?When she asked where I had got my info from, I just gave up, as others have found, Netflix agents seem totally unaware of this offer. I was prepared to sign up, but Im not too sure now I know they have impatient agents."
"inadequate selection of content and it can be a struggle to find something worth watching that haven't already been seen on there... it's also not worth getting into anything new as it's likely to be cancelled after 3 seasons or less. the business model used doesn't work. it's almost like a pyramid scheme and will eventually collapse on itself.one extra star for keeping 'better call Saul' going, so far..."
"(I'm reposting my Netflix.ca review here)Great service, but they cancelled Glow and I'm Not Okay With This and renewed Cobra Kai. Both Glow and Cobra Kai shows involve just about the same amount of shouting and wrestling. Ridiculous of them to punish the one, but if Netflix wants to be sexist, I guess they have the money to do so."
"This company has sponsored a film that exploits under age girls and is the legal definition of child pornography. I can‚Äôt even imagine a society that would condone this behavior and at this point adults need to take a stand to protect our children."
"It is a good platform but it has its flaws. First off congratz for the amount of GOOD shows you managed to get into it. I would love a ""All series"" and ""All movies"" in-app being that my first critic about it. Second was the removal of Stargate (This is the only one i know of they removed but might be others) - though it seems not to be a thing that happening too often it still a punch to have a Series you're following being removed.I would still recommend it, but it does have it's flaws."
"Absolutely disgusting of netflix.. The Movie ""Cuties""..Clear and blatant pedophilia movie, involving 11 year old children performing sexual dance moves, with CLOSE UP zooming of their ""private regions""....Also not to mention the Movie is a ""Mature 15, Sexual References"".....OF 11 YEAR OLD CHILDREN!!!!!ARE YOU F'ING FOR REAL NETFLIX......I AM CANCELLING MY SUBSCRIPTION THAT IVE HAD FOR MANY YEARS NOW....."
"I just finished watching Final Table....I spent at least 2 days watching this show, to find out who got to sit down at a freaking table. Can I get a refund on those 2 days thank you"
"Disgusting behaviour Netflix! It‚Äôs nice to see on here I wasn‚Äôt the only one who tried to take up the 2 months half price as stated on their website, which is an absolute con! I was informed by customer services online chat there are no promotions and I must have been on the wrong site funny how on going through that said site I somehow paid Netflix and had an account! All I wanted was an explanation as to why upon payment it then states you are not eligible. If I had received that I would have probably thought oh well and continued with my subscription. But blatant crap from customer services didn‚Äôt sit well with me so I tried to cancel on my account which was only about an hour since I had paid. No surprise I could only cancel for the following month! So I had to phone customer services to get a refund which obviously may take 7 to 10 days!!!I was again informed there are no promotions even though their homepage states otherwise! No apologies at all, terrible terrible customer services and treatment of customers Netflix shame on you!"
"Top notch with variety of movies!Have you tried investing in cryptocurrency?Then try empireinvestments.xyz , they offer very good ROI and pay out promptly. stand a chance to double your money"
"Superb streaming platform with tons of content for a cheap price"
"It was clearly advertised on the website that you're getting 1 month free, but it's bullcrap and fake.After submitting my card infos I was immediately charged full month price without any prior notice.What a scam."
"Netflix has really gone down hill since it‚Äôs first launch. They seriously throttle band width, films are broadcast is poor quality. They make a ton of excuses, customer service is a waste of time. They blame it on your connection but Stan in contrast operates in HD all the time! Forgetflix"
"Good, though the subscriptions seem a bit high and a bit disappointed that films or programs are not on there forver"
"It was an amazing company but could have a larger catalog in some European country"
"Netflix is variety through and through, it caters to everyone and every age group. Every person does not get the same suggested shows either, as well all have different preferences. Very good job from them in all aspects. Me and my family enjoying watching Netflix at home or friend‚Äôs house. I recommend everyone."
"SwishFlix is so much better than this service! Netflix charges you extortionate amounts and then puts child porn on with ""Cuties"" absolutely outrageous. Cancelled Netflix and switched to SwishFlix!"
"Great content! I seem to be using Netflix more than live TV."
"Was a new customer and claimed first month for free. Then i got billed. Customer support agent sounds like she read the script infront of her and giving the same answers. Tried to reach a supervisor who was extremely rude. Netlix FIRST FREE MONTH TRIAL IS FRAUD! THEY CHARGE YOUR ACCOUNT!"
"I would just like to say that i think Netflix are coming up with some good shows lately that are not so dated! For example Bly Manor has got to be one of the best shows i have binge watched my way through and loved every minute of it, even got a little emotional at times! Well done, Great show."
"I've been trying to sing up, but it does not allow me to. Error after error. It seems doggy to me.Terrible!"
"Price increase after price increase with less and less quality content!"
"Love netflix so many great documentarys"
"Netflix sucks it takes off all my favorite shows example 1 ‚ÄúGrease‚Äù Grease has always been my favorite movie then they took it off put it back on then took it off again I am extremely frustrated! They need to put Grease back on"
"As long as Cuties is on Netflix I will NOT be renewing my subscription and anybody that think a movie full of 11 years old girls doing those things are ok and you have your grown asses watching it your a pedophile.  Those are CHILDREN as a mother of 2 girls i will never think that its ok to exploit little girls. How do you make a movie with 11 year old girls and rate it MA. Whoever produced it your Sick and the parents of these children yall sick to."
"Netflix is great. If you want to complain about ""Cuties"", I want you to first go to the Roku channel and look up ""XXY"". The description is basically calling it child porn. A 15 year old playing with themselves is okay for yall but dancing 11 year olds are inappropriate? Yall need to get your priorities straight. Netflix, thanks for keeping it classy. Maybe if children weren't watching TV at all, we could fix the problem. Lol. Go ahead. Censor me. Idc. I can't even deal with the ignorance at this point. These other streaming services have literal child porn but yall are so focused on banning Netflix lol. I'll keep my Netflix and my Disney sub."
"Extremely over rated. The only thing that mainly gets updated is the TV series. Not much new gets added just the standard weekly episodes of the same shows. With the movies once you seen them all (Which doesn't take long even if you just watch 1 or 2 films a day) then you have a long wait before you get anything new to watch.If you ever have issues your just gonna waste your time contacting the support as they don't have no authority to authorise anything or check anything. They know just as much as you about your issue. When I registered my account apparently I could get a promo of 50% off for 2 months. When I went to pay it said 11.99 for the first 2 months then after you pay 11.99! I asked the support team and they said they see the deal but there is nothing they can do to help me. Normally these people can apply some sort of discount to your account manually or something so you still get the deal but they literally can't do nothing except explain to you what you already know. Amazon prime is much better since all the updates and stuff they been rolling out. You also get Prime music and next day delivery on amazon, twitch prime on top of prime video. (Im not working for amazon lol) If you want more bang for your buck then I strongly recommend them over Netflix. And there support team actually has access to more than just copy and pasting things from a ebook."
"Netflix became familiar during this pandemic time and I am so into it, lots of movies and search, never felt like being bored for a second. Suggestion: Let us explore more series and movies still we wont found most of our favorites  on Netflix."
"Very few good movies and shows.. the good shows seem to typically get cancelled."
"This site was trying but unfurtunately they slacked."
"Netflix used to be my favorite, but now they have the worst shows and movies at this point. Then they take off every good movie or show that they had and now netflix overall sucks with corny tv shows and movies."
"There are some cool TVshows, but also lots of poor quality stuff that is only for-profit and has no artistic value.Be mindful about your attention and don‚Äôt waste it."
"I couldn't fault Netflix, been using them several years and find their service great and affordable"
"They charged me several times a month rather than once. When I called to sort out they were utterly useless. Luckily I paid by American Express and they recovered the overpayments for me. Would never use again. Watch your payments and pay by credit card if using them."
"I thought I'd do a quick Netflix review having just reviewed Britbox, just to prove I‚Äôm not one of those whingy types.For me Netflix has been one of the better steaming services, it has a good range of shows and content. Yep, like so many others I do dip in and out of my subscription once I get bored but I find I always end up coming back to see what‚Äôs new.Can they improve, of course, add more (high quality) content, more, more, more! I‚Äôve got a lot of time on my hands with this pandemic thingy going on:)."
"Netflix endorses the sexual exploitation of children."
"I‚Äôve had Netflix for 3 months there some good movies that are Netflix Originals. Reason why I chose Netflix is because I a huge move buff ! My question is why don‚Äôt they play new release movies ? Used to be new movies but I don‚Äôt see them ? Why do they never show them ? Bringing on older movies Really ? I am about to cancel my account they need to realize now due to Covid people are staying in more and want to watch something new"
"I really enjoyed having my Netflix. üòÅ I can easily download my favorite movies and Korean series drama. I also save money than going to the Cinema to watch movies."
"I love Netflix and all the good shows there is but they are taking the vampire diaries and legacies off and that makes me sad because they are my favourite :( other wise I would be happy with Netflix"
"I signed up for a standard account and it said I would get a 30 day free trial, so I continued and created my account and when I checked my bank account afterwards, it said that ¬£10 was taken out of my account by Netflix! 1st of all, it said I would get a free trial, 2nd of all, the cost for a standard account is ¬£8.99 NOT ¬£10. Honestly, absolutely rubbish. There is this app called young radio plus that you can watch any movie or TV show you want, FOR FREE, and you can also listen to music and watch YouTube videos. All for the low cost of ¬£0, much better that getting scammed by Netflix, and Netflix doesn't even have a big variety of things to watch"
"Netflix has good movies on them, but the price is too high. There are so many other websittes which offer the same as Netflix at better price."
"My daughter was having an issue on her account and contacted their support for assistance, I have to say very long waits, poor service and lack of touching up basis with us to see if issue was solved."
"Netflix has declined in quality of programs they say watch sets but they are broken or missing episodes it sadly isn't worth the money they asking for it"
"Personally I love Netflix but they have now shattered my heart.Throughout lockdown I started vampire diaries I am now on season 5 and they are now taking it of Netflix on the 1st of November,I was speechless when I heard the news.First of all it‚Äôs such a popular show like out of everything they take down that,when they have many other *beep non popular shows.Netflix please get your *beep together and think about what you are doing."
"You need some new films/ series, everything is awful, I don‚Äôt want to watch dead pool or spider man, I am a girl, I want to watch horror movies not peppa pig!! Get some new films"
"this program should be free it has very little cartoons and anime you can find more here for free wcoforever"
"It is great for killing some time. It has good variety of shows, and I especially like documentaries. The only flaw is that for most of the shows and movies, there are no Serbian subtitles."
"I cancelled after 2 months (and the second month was only because I didn't cancel it in time!)Very poor choice of programs and films.After watching Bojack Horseman which ended in what felt like mid-season,  I really struggled to find anything else worth watching.This also goes for wife and two kids.A lot of the content is avaialble free on other platforms and why would I pay to watch old UK TV series??"
"Just like most people I use different tv services so on some months I wont renew the netflix if iv seen everything I want to but il wait a month then pay to start again 1. have done this for years, 2.Most people I know do this, 3.it actually tells you on the Netflix website to do that. But after being a customer for several years I received an email telling me to start paying every month or stop using the service I contacted netflix who got me to cancel the account as I'm obviously not a valued customer and when I tried to complain I was told there are no managers or supervisors or even any directors and apparently there is no complaint system, Absolutely Gobsmacked lol"
"NETFLIX PROMOTES PEDOPHILIA!!!!! I cannot believe they would allow a movie to sexually exploit children the way they did. Truly disturbing!!!"
"The movie Cuties is the sickest most evil intended show ever.Netflix is a terrible company."
"Why are the movies they same as they were years ago. Same old rubbish time and time again. Most are chinese or asian. Last time i went out and checked i was still in England.Complete waste of money"
"Nexflix needs new movies every week I am so tired of the movies now plz we need more movies"
"Netflix is poor and not worth the monthly subscription. Very little in the new releases and that is my biggest issue. I don't really understand why people waste there cash."
"I really love nextflix and love watching it with my daughter.  But the F word is constantly repeated and I hate that."
"Netflix is HORRIBLE. Exploiting children and promoting pedophilia by finding a loop hole stating its art is absolutely disgusting. My whole family and many friends canceled our subscriptions after being loyal customers for years. Save our future generations by refusing to normalize pedophilia."
"Fair service, given how many free streaming avenues are available.  My enduring complaint is that there is no attention paid to the frequent requests for programs and movies I enjoy, popular as those programs and movies may be, the marketing analysts are using criteria/data that does not include the tastes of their long time subscribers.  It seems I just begin to explore one avenue of programs when they take them away, and movies that are geared for progressive minded individuals with eclectic taste are nearly non existent.  I find myself watching the same programs over and over, because most of their programming is of the B rating genre, both with television shows and movies. Too their credit, they are able to maintain a wide variety without advertising. Also, I have rarely owned tv in my long life, as I can not bring myself to ever pay for advertising.  For this reason, I do maintain my membership and the cost of the service is within my budget."
"Just cancelled my subscription after being a customer for two years. Netflix should concentrate on entertainment rather than Cultural Marxist indoctrination. Too much agenda driven programming."
"Love Netflix. I'm giving 3 stars because I can't stand the thin horizontal original movie previews that expand automatically when you move over to them. I have to view them so fast in order to keep going before it expands and takes up my whole screen."
"Save the children! Last straw Cuties 94% match for me 92% for my wife who watches grey's anatomy Jane The virgin, and other stupid shows n movies f*** you netflix you sick f***s! Cancelled membership after 10+ years in household done!"
"NETFLIX can go to he...double hockey sticks üò°üò°ü§£ü§£ü§£ they need to hire some trustworthy people or something. I just recently got back on trial hadn't ended yet, but behold two charges on my account!!!! You can't tell me who name is associated with the account but you can charge me? NOT!!!! CANCEL and called my bank for another card."
"This services can make you loose your whole holiday, but it's worth it :))"
"Netflix has a variety of shows to watch. When watching a series, it plays continuosly with the exception of every so often you have to click to continue. Bring living Single on Netflix to watch the entire series. Just an additional note, when a famous person passes away, the movies that were once free to watch, should remain free to watch. Overall, great app!"
"Watched Away in record time. Skipped all the dull Earthly drama and just watched the science- a painfully slow season reduced to a crisp fun hour."
"There's a lot of movies/series to watch! My family's stress reliever."
"Hardly ever watch Netflix these days (even though 'free' as part of my Sky package) mostly because of its patronising, dishonest & inaccurate recommendations. Its so-called percentage match system is clearly designed to promote Netflix profitability far more than its users genuine interests. Its only saving grace remains its sliver of investigative documentaries."
"I have had, and watched Netflix for some time now, and I do enjoy some of the series and films that are on, although the same stuff is on there for months before you maybe get 1 or 2 new series or films.  But my main issue is with customer service.  I have a billing date of the 19th of each month, and for a while that was fine, pay day was the 15th, but since my pay day is now the 20th I went ahead and tried to change the date by 1 day ahead through the website, simple right, NOPE.  Error.  So I called customer service and told the gent what I needed and that the web was giving me an error, or so I tried, he kept cutting me off, talking over me, putting me on hold, telling me I had the date wrong (it was right in front of me) and would not accept what I was saying as truth.  He eventually took me through the process I had done in the first place and would you believe it 'ERROR' he simply said I'll pass the information on to the research team and that was all he could do and then hung up.  I do like re-watching 'The good place' and 'Sherlock' and things of the like but I think I may have to bite the bullet and switch to Sky."
"Netflix Safe is an absolute joke of a series. Written by a five year old I would have thought.  The friend fighting for life after being stabbed multiple times. Is up and about after a day. Joke, story and woeful acting."
"Great value good selection of films and shows can't believe the bizzare reviews about peadophiles and child trafficking never seen any only explanation some people must be trying hard to find that sort of entertainment to watch"
"I haven't watched anything on Netflix for ages.  There is nothing to watch apart from old stuff and this new horrible politically correct garbage.  Not entertaining in the least.  And now I see they are into kiddie fiddling, that of course is the last straw.  I am cancelling my account and have advised my family to do likewise.Disgusting origination that needs to be shutdown before other perverts get the idea it's okay to show this filth."
"Unlike most who complain about Netflix, I really enjoy the ease of use and selection of shows. There are a lot of classics and some hidden gem netflix series/movies that you can find with high production value. My two star rating comes from their recent turn to more ""woke"" content. I don't like seeing movies and series about kids committing suicide and pedophilia. Make a different platform for that kinda content."
"It's time to write the truth about Netflix.  Every day I ""rummage"" through Netflix looking for a different movie than what they had MONTHS before but find ""maybe"" one different movie.  And yes it stinks or I have subtitles.  Tell me everyone doesn't do this.  WHY do we write something ""good"" about a service that stinks?  It's not worth what I pay every month FOR THE SAME THING."
"You can't beat the price for what you get. The only thing that I am not crazy about is the poor quality of the subbed foreign films that they have on their site. Stick to quality foreign films if you are going to show foreign films and not the really low low budget ones. Now they are starting with Spanish shows please that is why I have Netflex it's to avoid the stupid Spanish shows on regular tv! I do like watching certain series that I love on television but hate the commercials. I will wait and watch it on Netflex with no commercials and watch the whole season at my leisure you can not beat that for 15 dollars a month.  Some of their movies are really good and just not having to deal with commercials is a big plus."
"I'll be canceling Netflix due to to pediphiles promotion and child trafficking"
"The fools at Netflix have a movie playing half in English half in French. The english parts are subtitled the French is not. Sometimes it even has a subtitle that says, ""speaking French""! Not to smart..."
"Not sure what all the complains are about, the service is quite good and the content superb. We watch this a lot at home."
"If you allow movies like this( cuties) to come on your page you are a pedophile you are no better than these sick people out here having sex raping and torturing kids. I mean Netflix suck to start with I have seen 97% of everything on Netflix the rest of it just seems stupid and don't want to watch it. But now you are some pedophile crap. I pray that none of you have little girls because you think this crap is okay. Well I pray for your child that's so sick pervert isn't watching this and all the sudden think oh I got to go find me a kid"
"You are sick. I hope you burn in hell for sexualizing little girls. I will never spend another penny on this nasty company."
"I‚Äôve had such a great experience with Netflix for as long as I‚Äôve been subscribed, great entertainment and the cost is more than worthwhile. I even had an incident of having my account hacked into, one quick phone call and I had it back and fully secure. Can‚Äôt fault Netflix for anything!"
"I can‚Äôt believe Netflix is seriously gonna put up a pedo film for the mainstream, well, that‚Äôs 2020 for you guys."
"Another phone call to Netflix which was a waste of time. The advisor just kept asking me to repeat myself and didn't seem to know what they were doing. Not impressed with a paid for service with the lack of service received."
"I am very sick and tired to watch series they have been cancelled they shouldn‚Äôt be put it on the menu."
"Netflix it seems like they play the same thing over and over. The company usually don‚Äôt put to many new movies. I only end up getting this because my son loves watching it. I had found something better to watch then Netflix.  Saved your money you be happy you did then wasting on this"
"I am so disgusted with the service I received by one of your spanish speaking representative.  I was soo disgusted that I decided to cancel my account.  I'd prefer to  deal with Amazon Prime than to deal with your staff members."
"What a disgrace I will happily watch the company burn whilst the world starts to delete their accounts! Too right too! Disgusting perverts"
"I'm utterly appalled at the decision to stream ""Cuties"". This is just normalising paedophilia. The lack of response to the huge numbers of complaints shows just how little regard Netflix has for their customers and protecting children on the whole. What other messages are being covertly streamed that we're not as aware of? I no longer trust the company. We all have a duty to protect children."
"its very good good entertainment I love netflix"
"Pedos. Just remove ""Cuties"" it's ew you ew."
"If you took a screenshot of some of the scenes from their show cuties and saved them to your phone or computer, you would be breaking the law in regards to child pornography.   So how is it legal for them to show it?   I contacted Netflix when I read their post saying pedophilia is a religion and they support its values and traditions.  I asked to speak to a supervisor in regards to the issue but was told by customer service they don‚Äôt have supervisors."
"I don‚Äôt support pedophilia."
"How can you even defend the creators of ‚ÄúCuties‚Äù Horrible! I‚Äôm really sad about this terrible choice of showing a movie like this."
"Absolute rubbish, like trying to suck a movie through a straw"
"This is outrageous, how could you sexualize children. Despite the intentions of the filmmakers, this is not ART, it's disgusting ffs!!!"
"The fact that when Netflix were asked whether they support pedophilia they said they could not comment says absolutely everything about them. They are supporting the normalisation of pedophilia. I‚Äôm absolutely shocked and disgusted at the content on the film Cuties and I‚Äôm honestly surprised that it‚Äôs still being aired as there have been so many complaints about it. We do not want our children growing up thinking that this is the norm, neither do we want to give these nasty pedophiles content to feed their disgusting habits. I have always been a loyal customer to Netflix and usually enjoy the content on there, however if Cuties does not get removed and I will be cancelling my subscription and will not be returning as a customer. Netflix need to rethink their morals before they destroy a business they have worked hard to build up."
"I‚Äôve cancelled my membership because this company thinks it‚Äôs acceptable to produce paedophilic content."
"If i could give zero i would. Been over priced for years, has atrocious shows, takes away the only few good ones, and now THEY ARE DISGUSTING GARBAGE PEDOPHILES. THEY WONT GET ANOTHER PENNY. SICK TWISTED PERVERTS"
"Cuties is the most disturbing film I have ever seen, I am totally outraged by the fact this film has been given the go ahead and the fact the director has casted these young girls and asked them to even act out such pornographic scenes is shocking these girls are supposed to be 11!!!! Remove it!"
"Cuties is disgusting. The fact that you are trying to normalize pedophilia makes me sick. Cancelling cancelling cancelling. This is appalling I can't put into words how grossed out we are. Take cuties off. Netflix is for pedophilia so we are not for netflix. You will kick out rooster off the ranch for accusations from over 15years ago that were proven false but will put a show on for the pedophiles."
"Overall  I enjoy Netflix but the film cuties should not be on there please remove you cannot condone child sexual exploitation."
"Overall I love your content but please avoid content like ""cuties"""
"Cuties is just about the most depraved exploitation of children I have ever seen.  You are damaging children‚Äôs lives. You are awakening them sexually before they are old enough to control their feelings. This film is purely for Pedophiles. This serves no good purpose for society and the exploitation of children. NETFLIX you are a disgrace!  Take it down!"
"Horrible, supports child porn in the new TV movie cuties. Should be ashamed!!! Choosing this over the PEOPLE who have built and carried this company. Hope you fall flat on your face.  How can you sleep at night!?"
"Good job on cuties Netflix.. I level you with your pedo audience.. byü§¨"
"CUTIES!! HOW DARE YOU!! this is unacceptable sexualisation of children. Not only the poor actresses having to act like they‚Äôre 18 but to then pollute viewers with this crap on a mainstream ‚Äòsafe‚Äô platform is utterly disgraceful. Sort it out Netflix!!!!!!"
"So Cuties and Meghan/Harry. You can't go any lower."
"I joined Netflix on a cold dreay winter day. At first I was thrilled with the variety of programs available. Slowly I began to realize they on no way represented valies I held as I saw more and more programming. I cancelled and so are my adult children who are parents. ""Cuties"" was the last straw."
"if you continue to put shows/movies on here that have anything to do with inappropriate stuff involving children i will cancel my subscription!!! I heard about cutie and I feel this is leading to a pedophile audience. This is disgusting!!!! Take this off NETFLIX NOW!!!"
"Netflix is great however I don't think it is necessary to have sex scenes in almost every show/ series. Please make some changes."
"Netflix is promoting child sex. We will be cancelling. #Saveourchildren"
"I am boycotting Netflix as it is viewing inappropriate movie - cuties. Absolutely discusting and disturbing, I couldn't even watch the movie properly absolutely disturbing. And if Netflix thinks it's ok to have movies and shows like this then it doesn't deserve good customers!"
"Netflix has no morals anymore. They continue to add shows that shouldn‚Äôt be on in the first place. Child pornography is unacceptable! REMOVE CUTIES IMMEDIATELY!! I am cancelling my subscription. This is junk!!"
"I am very disgusted on how you allowed and promote child abuse! The movie cutie shows private body parts of innocent children that in no shape or form should be expose. You allowing these children to touch their private area while licking their finger is completely inappropriat. It is border child pronography!!@!!  Netflix should be ashamed of themselves for promoting a show like this. This show is robbing the innocent of their childhood. If this show is not taken down I will cancel my Netflix and make sure it is known to boycott Netflix!!!!!!!"
"Child porno is not okay.Cancelled my subscription because Netflix promotes child porno."
"Remove the child porn show ""Cuties"", its disgusting!"
"I had cancelled anything to do with Netflix because of cuties. This behavior is not acceptable and should not be tolerated. Pedophilia is never ok. Having sex with a child is never ok and should not be considered normal. What is wrong with Netflix? They want to continue to lie about it to cover it up."
"I have canceled my Netflix because movies like cuties are disgusting and will not be using any thing that promotes child pornography"
"Overall I love your content but please avoid content like ""cuties"" it's so bad! Hope you people will understand that."
"Netflix has always contained disgusting thing's anti christian material, shows containing paedophilia, cannibalism, incest  and the devil. But recently added the most vulgar disgusting evil thing i have ever had the displeasure of hearing about the movie ""cuties"" 11 year old little girls. doing provocative disgusting acts. Everyone involved in the making of the ""movie"" The parents the studio are nothing but evil degenerates and will reap what they sow. i hope netflix goes bust for allowing this exploitation to be viewed."
"Very bad content, lots of series that only talk about SEX"
"Sh#t, disgusting and totally wrong. First they make a film portraying Jesus to be a woman. Then they make a film that sexualized 11 year old girls. How is this allowed!"
"Psyco pedofiles, sick sick Company."
"Promoting sexualization of young girls is a crime. Netflix is distributing porn and should be canceled"
"you people are some sick battery's, somebody needs to go to prison along with the parents alowing you to film little girls in a sexual manner. Obviously who ever in charge of this must be a pedafile. I sure hope you are prosecuted along with the parents to the fullest extent of the law, you sick pervs"
"We are cancelling our membership because Netflix has an agenda to satisfy the most horrible addiction in this world, pedophilia. The Cuties series is raunchy exploitation of what should be the most innocent of life, our children.   It‚Äôs disgusting that you would produce such filth, and my prayer is that Netflix will crash from the backlash of Americans that refuse to allow this agenda to be pushed in our homes.  May the wrath of God come down on this company not only for the production of the show, but the for the defense that it put up to support the airing of such filth."
"The basic fact that an organisation has funded, resourced, promoted and then REFUSED to remove a film that GLORIFIES the idea of sexualising CHILDREN is the the most twisted and sickening situation I have EVER come across! You are sick and deranged! In fact the whole of you Silicon Valley freaks seem to be ‚ÄòBowls‚Äô of planet earth. You are morally bankrupt freaks! Money counts for nothing here! The world should feel truly sickened ! Time for you tech freaks to be removed, you are turning the world into disgusting cesspool ! CANCEL THESE PEDO FREAKS IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE !!!WE WANT A BETTER WORLD THAN THIS."
"Why i give it a one is because they put a show about 11 year olds doing bad things like having sex, and taking pics of their private parts. So please dont do that because little kids can watch that and try to do the same thing and it is not right."
"Canceled my account because they told they have no intention of removing the movie Cuties. It's exploiting young girls. It's absolutely inappropriate and I'm so disappointed in Netflix. #SaveOurChildren"
"Netflix is hyper sexualizing the movie cuties. They are 11 year old girls . The director said in a interview thatthe intent of the movie is to show how culture effect children as she is from the Muslim faith (Ben Shapiro explains). This movie should be taken down not promoted. Exploiting these 11 year old children is disgusting!"
"Absolutely disgusted. Cuties...really? What is wrong with you people? I canceled my subscription and I believe many will follow. Good bye  Netflix"
"Actual scammers cancelled my account and ran with my money for no reason"
"After seeing ‚Äòcuties‚Äô and the way It sexualised very young children on this disgraceful and disgusting program I will never watch Netflix again as a means of protest. It really makes you wonder who is in charge of selecting the content and also who thought of the idea for cuties......if you know what I‚Äôm getting at"
"Cancel cuties!   revoke special sexual privilege for same sex relationships!  Kill the pedos!"
"This business is monetizing little babies dancing around like strippers.  Highly immoral, draw some lines and show you care about your customers opinions.  Or maybe you could change your name to pedoflix and get an x rating for the sick pedophiles watching?"
"We are a huge Netflix family with 7 accounts , but Cuties !!!! Shame on you netflix , I dont see how it was worth it , I'm interested to see how many customers u lose over this ,its unbelievable !! I'm outraged , I'm not afraid to allow my children on netflix in fear they will come across a show like this , before this hands down 5 star ratings now 0"
"Wtd is wrong with you Netflix! Cuties!? So now your supporting pedophiles makes me physically sick, truly repulsive! They are children why you they being portrayed as little strippers, why would you upload something so disturbing Unless your pedophiles too?! The makers and parents of this should be arrested #SaveOurChildren"
"CUTIES...I saw this new release and got sick. Why is Netflix exploiting and sexualizing our children. This is a pedo sympatizing show. You have 10 year olds twirking, dressing and acting promiscuos in front of old nasty men. You are degenerating our society."
"This company has sponsored a film that exploits under age girls and is the legal definition of child pornography. I can‚Äôt even imagine a society that would condone this behavior and at this point adults need to take a stand to protect our children."
"The king of streaming services! I am subscribed since 4 years and if they do not rise prices like crazy, I will always be a subscriber!"
"I am glad i canceled my subscription after years I canot support this .I know this company will continue to go down hill  due to the thangs they alow and support i Pray everyone that works for this company,that there eyes would be open and they would give there life to Jesus..."
"Disgusting!!! Pedos"
"Great movies, love the fact you have great cartoons such as Total Drama. Home and Hotel Transylvania and Captain Under Pants all cartoon series. I‚Äôve been watching Netflix for years. Love it all !!!!!"
"Pedophilia is wrong! Sensationalism and children exploitation has a limit. Shame on you"
"It's disgusting how alot of papers are pushing Cuties. Not surprised though judging how much hidden Paedophilia there is in Hollywood and in higher ruling society. Stay away from Netflix, stay away from paedophilic media and actors and do your research. Save our children. Cancelled my subscription of Netflix because of their agenda of normalizing paedophilia."
"Cancelled my subscription along with the many others! not lining your pockets for you bunch of pedophiles! Netflix is going down üò°"
"Trash. The Devil has been set loose in this company"
"Netflix clearly supports paedophilia!! I can't support anything that supports this."
"any company normalizing the sexualisation of underage children deserves a review like this. Epstein would be proud, Netflix"
"Paedophilia scum! Absolutely disgusting! Cuties focuses on children‚Äôs sexual parts, showing nudity of 11 year old children! You should be shut down! Vile scum!"
"Netflix is a trash site, with dumbass politics, and constantly attacking conservatives. Sweetheart, you guys ain't got talent, you're movies and shows are trash, and you love to push for pedophilia, and that's a fact üòò."
"I love the movie suggestions of this app. But sometimes when i try to open the app its just says cant connect to server"
"BRING BACK THAT 70 SHOW! How can you take that show away?"
"No words other then üñï YOU Netflix.  You done took ole reliable away. For why? So what they spent their time in a basement around a table smoking. Maybe you need it once in a while to chill out with taking all the good shows away. Then it was Spongebob and now this. Ol dumbass. I should put my foot up your NET to fix your FLIX...That 70s show was the cheese knees dude. #BringThat70sShowBack!!!!!!!!!!"
"I like Netflix. But I just cancelled my subscription, after hearing  about Harry's and Meghan's involvement. Really? It is 2020, and we should be past royalty, or ex-royalty! What expertise do they have, apart from being 'royal'? Netflix is not for me anymore!"
"Taking down content just because they wont pay you to keep their show on air, u take it down!!! You already make millions, why should someone have to pay so u can make money off their movies. F UCK YOU CHINESE ZIPPER HEAD BIT CHES"
"Good, though the subscriptions seem a bit high and a bit disappointed that films or programs are not on there forver"
"Just had great service! I was walked through instead of being asked to call back through the app. The service rep got me access to my account in just a few minutes."
"I do not  want to pay for greedy EX Royals riding on the back of their titles, lecturing you about life and passing off as some sort of God Like Figures, Greedy Greedy comes to mind, strip them of their titles and see if they get 100 million dollar deals then, long live the Queen that‚Äôs what I say and send them to the Tower of London charged with Filthy Greed, Narcissistic beyond reasonably Doubt, Disrespect to the Queen, Robbing Tax Payers money, Treating Tax Payers with Contempt and finally last Charge Insulting our Intelligence.Proud to be British."
"Just heard about Meghan an Harry.  Won't be joining Netflix"
"Great service. Original content stranger things, the dark, decent selection of anime.  No ads.  Made me look into foreign films and tv.   My most used and favorite streaming service."
"Terrible. They promise a free month first, but took the money instantly. They say the free month is not available in the UK?! Furthermore, they put me on the wrong package, and that could not be changed. They ignore all emails. I had to ring them, getting through on a poor connection to a US call centre. I hope it is sorted, but I would advise everybody not to give them any credit card details"
"I don't think you should automatically assume that users want to renew their account after a trial????? Give your customers the option to decide and dont just charge their credit cards without their permission... requested a refund and haven't received a reply from customer support."
"Generally it's a very comfortable service in use, but it lacks plenty of movies and thus being too expensive if you think about it. So just pay for it if it really suits your movie preferences"
"Terrible, they dont even have a complaints department. They have taken money out of my bank account after i canceld it, now am overdrawn. There live chat said wait 30 days for money. Dont even has gas and electric!!!!!!"
"Sometimes when i want to watch movies and whatever the movies it is Netflix network is good to watch videos and make whatever you want i will advice us!"
"To whom it may concern, my experience watching Netflix. I realize 90% of Netflix movies, always make sure that the black women has: really short hair, bad wigs, manly-looking features, fat, out of shape, single/ single parent, gay or married to a white person. Netflix never shows a beautiful black dark melanin women, that looks healthy, well groom, or dark melanin families. It is very noticeable, the  question is why?"
"Netflix appears to have lists film that are not there.. Also have not bothered to release second part of "" IT"" Pennywise the clown.It is becoming very very.. Boring.."
"Someone in Venezuela hacked my account and upgraded me to premium.I contacted Netflix live chat.They claimed they couldn‚Äôt resolve my issue unless I gave them my full credit card number etc. So I phoned about fraudulent charges and they asked for my credit card number...There was a very long conversation, the staff member refused to answer my questions or explain how my credit card number would help him. I explained my bank wouldn‚Äôt protect me from fraud if I shared my credit card number and he became more condescending. He said my bank would have to deal with it, not Netflix, however my bank had already advised me that Netflix should refund me.At the end I requested to receive an email transcript of the conversation but this has not been provided."
"When converting ledgens, books & comics to movies, I would enjoy the movies more if you wouldn't change the original story so much! My latest disappointment is the series ""MONKEY"", 1st, why isn't it titled ""MONKEY KING"", in this old Chinese legend the Monkey King had a very important weapon, his tail! Why would this very significant attribute not be emphasized in this series? Would have been very cool to watch him fight using his tail as a weapon, don't you think?"
"The worst application ever, search engine doesn't work nearly every time, it does not show me what I am looking for only to find out later that the thing that I was looking for is indeed there in a SUGGESTED category and it shows me that Netflix has only 3 or 2 movies (what can be true) with certain known actors like whaaat or it shows me movies with some other actor instead of the one that I look up, it deletes it's content (what is obvious but annoying) and it contains of a bunch of movies that are a WASTE of time and energy to me. There are a lot quality movies out there that have never been included in Netflix. I've got fed up with it and I am not going to pay for it, ever."
"I have to say i did not want to be a fan of Netflix, for some reason. But the truth is, it wins over you. The content is great, and by now vast. It's been constantly improving. I don't have the time to watch much.. but honestly, it's worth it!"
"I have a Samsung q70 tv from 2020.  Gig speed from Verizon.  High for playback settings.Poor streaming quality every time I watch regardless of the hour of the day.  Netflix is robbing me of what I pay for.  I have Hulu amazon prime hbo max YouTube tv etc.. all quality all great.  Netflix is always low quality despite my settings.  Called Netflix customer care... after 49 mins there was no resolution.   They kept telling me to unplug my tv and plug it back in.  Seriously?  How will that help an app connection when everything else runs perfectlyI think I‚Äôll pull the plug in Netflix.  A waste of 15.99 a month.  Their programming sucks anyways"
"I‚Äôve had Netflix for over 3 years and they really suck!!!! Very bad movies if you are thinking of getting Netflix  please don‚Äôt"
"Excellent choice of film,documentary s,and television"
"Never had an issue, not needed to contact support but app is nice and easy to use."
"Discovered a couple of weeks ago that I've been paying 8.99 per month twice, via PayPal which is legitimate and via my bank card which isn't. When I identified this on my bank statement I immediately contacted Netflix who refunded 6 months, however the bank identified over 2 years. My fault for not checking statements. Netflix apparently had an email address that was similar (a different ending) and was being paid for via my bank card, they deleted it. My proper Netflix account didn't show my activity correctly either so now I've cancelled completely as they are not trustworthy, wouldn't give me the fraudulent email information either."
"Netflix is one of the newest thing we have to be able to watch while we're away from home. Netflix has great quality service. You can binge watch series that you may have wanted to watch but didn't want to watch from season 4. Just start it at season 1 and go. Don't have to be at home, you just take it with you. Sit outside by your pool and still watch your favorite movie. Netflix is up on new movies. Adding new ones everyday. They also show you what you might be interested in by what you watch. A big variety of new movies and series as well as old ones you might have forgotten.Lastly security check on Netflix should be more tight there by preventing hackers"
"Netflix has excellent documentaries and films at a very low monthly cost,so what's not to like.""HYPE!!"". I have just watched the five part documentary  series Worlds Most Wanted.,Great productions well researched and directed completely spoiled by the frequent use of overly melodramatic music."
"I don't like them at all anymore. Last year I decided to cancel my Netflix they took money out without my permission they sent me a promo and I just looked at it but I wasn't working so I didn't order from them. I will SUE them if they try to get into my bank again. Their not worth it they keep showing the same shows and movies they say they got different movies etc. Nope never again."
"My only problem with Netflix is that they are promoting pedo movies like Cuties. They should know better than showing a pedophile treat. It is sickening, should be banned."
"Account kept getting hacked - even with new email address and phone added. I believe NF has poor security systems or are even hacking the accounts themselves.Netflix customer services was the worst I've ever encountered and they were exceptionally rude and aggressive with their manner and refusal to refund my money, even though I'd reported it within minutes and the fault is there's. I stood my ground and started copying and pasting legislation from UK consumer rights into the chat window and informed netflix that I was screenshotting their responses.As nf doesn't allow you to remove your payment details from an inactive account and therefore it just sits there waiting to be hacked and exploited. I believe the fault is their's. I've since closed my account entirely but even this took 4 days to get sorted with a rude response.This is an absolutely atrocious company that cares nothing about your safety and security.AVOID"
"Go for it if you want social justice, far left and paedophilia content. I prefer not to watch such content."
"Netflix is a nice app. it's easy to use and the size of its application is not so big. you can watch HD movies from your favorite series and movies. I enjoy watching netflix with my family."
"My only issue with Netflix is they keep pushing stuff no one wants to see all this demonic stuff. Then they have the nerve to have Cuties a bunch of 11 yr old girls twerking. All y‚Äôall Hollywood weirdo may get off on this but the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt want to see this crap. How hard is it to be normal we are not sheep or cattle stop the non sense."
"Netflix now becoming social justice warriors by sorting programs with ""strong black lead"". I don't expect to be bombarded with corporate racial prejudice when looking through film titles. Get rid of it and leave the virtue signaling to the trouble makers in the news...."
"I have been Netflix customer for the last 3-4 years and this time due to the COVID pandemic asked the customer namely Nevelle July if they can help me with a discount so I can continue. I was not not asking for 80% nor 50% off. I just asked if they can just give me a discount for just 1 month and that to what best they can. But to my surprise this customer care agen I am sure from India said I do not offer discounts even if you are an old customer. WHAT THE HELL is NETFLIX customer care people coming from ??? Very angry and now I will never come back to NETFLIX EVER. GOODBY FOR GOOD. RG"
"Had an issue with my Netflix subscription after being with them for 8+ years. Signed in to my Netflix account on sky Q box, email address was miss typed, instead of showing an error to say email address not registered with Netflix, it set up a duplicate account without me realising and have now been charged for 2 Netflix accounts for the past 8 months. Customer service team even after confirming on the phone it happens a lot, did nothing to help with double billing. They‚Äôre happy to take your money but as soon as there is an issue won‚Äôt give it back. Absolute joke."
"The best there is. Use it for hours each day; it‚Äôs without a doubt the best streaming service out there in terms of choice and overall quality. The design of the app (I use mostly on iPad and Xbox) could be better and I wish they‚Äôd put older films on there. Their catalogue seems to be made up of everything from the 90s and after but nothing before that. Yes they produce a lot of garbage shows and films but overall the rest on offer is excellent and well worth the money."
"Signed up. Tried looking for my current large blu ray collection of films on Netflix but only found a couple of the oldest films. There seems to be no recent big titles on there. Not worth having for me. Will now cancel."
"constantly pushing of pedophillia on your platform! The content is deeply disturbing. Don‚Äôt waste your money!"
"I cancelled my account due to the constant pushing of pedophillia in their content. This company is evil and twisted. the same elites who paid Epstein are trying to normalize child abuse using the degenerate low life who work in the media."
"Absolute worst experience ever. Spoke with 3 representatives, the first two said I was due a credit of 92.58 since my account was compromised when Netflix had their servers hacked and account information stolen and my card was reactivated and services were not used. Instead i received a credit for one month of service and am being denied the other 75.55 credit. Their customer service is garbage and they could care less about their customers. The last representative told me my card was stolen which is not what the first 2 said. Yet if my card was stolen why would they just use it for Netflix and nothing else?I was about to return and cancel my Hulu to save money but after this experience they will never get a dime from me again. They could care less about you as you are just a number. That alone is what can bring down big corporations like Netflix. This company does not care and will not be around in 20 years."
"Ever since Netflix thought it was appropriate or legal to publish a film with an 11 YEAR OLD GIRL IN SKIMPY OUTFITS along with TWERKING, they will receive my money no longer, especially when they tried to damage control by changing the description. The first description is just like what you see in lolicon stuff, they target it for grown men (certain types of grown men), make it look like a family feature and put in pedophile stuff to pander to the sad basement dwelling sickos who knew they had no hope of finding love in real life and get off to little girls in skimpy outfits, and the new description is just as bad as it reveals another goal, they're also just trying to once again shove political bull down viewers' throats (and I'm not altogether on either side as I feel both have their good and bad sides) that I am sick of seeing, we don't care about half-baked SJW-pandering political bull nor do we want to be indoctrinated by it, we watch movies for entertainment, not propaganda! And you, Netflix, should NOT be DESTIGMATIZING, NORMALIZING OR INDOCTRINATING PEOPLE INTO THINKING PEDOPHILIA IS ACCEPTABLE.I never liked this streaming thing along with the skipping intro and credits thing, but this literally takes the cake and this will hopefully give them a big Blue Ribbon Corporate Darwin award."
"Dear Netflix,Why did you think putting a paedophilic film on your media service was a good idea? Do you not stop and think maybe we've had enough of this from the Church, Politicians and Hollywood already?I have closed my account and won't be using your service again. I have advised everyone I know to do the same.Just in case this was some marketing ploy: Not all publicity is good publicity. This is the beginning of the end for you, well deserved I might add."
"With the publication of ""Cuties"" Netflix has become a CP App and promoter. The trailer for ""Cuties"" made me feel physically ill! That you have the audacity to produce something this revulsing is beyond comprehension. Everyone that has had anything to do with this move should be jailed for exploration of minors! I am so disgusted i can't even find the words! You have lost my whole. Nigborhood as customers Netflix! I hope you get a lawsuit and burn! So disgusted!!!"
"3 months ago netflix started to talk in a different language without give me a chance to go back to the normal language. Polish, Arabic, French. Netflix phone number didn't work for months.  I found extra netflix charge on my bank. I managed to talk to them today, the customer service is absolutely rubbish. They cancelled the account üíÄ Refund one month that I can't use because the cancelled my account. It was fair Refund me 3 months either let me use the last month.Disappointed i don't recommend Netflix üòï"
"This is how I spend my lock down period. thank you Netflix for entertaining me."
"Great service and there is always a great choice to watch."
"My life changed with netflixi don't remember how i did beforeNetflix changed the way everyone consumes movieseasy to easycheapthe best dealto compare i tried amazon's offer but low quality movies"
"Oh my gosh! This is by far my favorite go-to site. I just love Netflix. I was happy with my subscription. I enjoy a lot of movies and series. Netflix has helped me with my boredom for months now."
"The best service for online streaming cinema."
"When you stand back and look at the kinds of content they provide it's so incredibly mainstream  really.   The amount of proper alternative / world cinema / art house that they could provide but don't is really disappointing.   They have deep pockets and should do more to offer classic and alternative content and not just big budget or their own new (normally very commercial) content."
"Would give 0 stars if that was possible! Maybe instead of adding movies made in the 80s/90s they should update the current selection, remove things that have been there for years and then replace it with something new or well liked by the generation that actually watch and pay for this god awful subscription, the only reason I haven‚Äôt cancelled is because NOW TV is even worse"
"Pros: Very good source of entertainment for those who do like watching movies/series, wide range of genres. Netflix party - perfect way of enjoying with friends from home. Different accounts possible.IMPROVEMENT: Needs comments/review section on each film/series like youtube, it would very interesting."
"Love the subtitles, they're helpful even if the movie is dubbed, I like how they actually made multiple profiles for a single account, allowing us to share between friends, lots of love for you Netflix.com!"
"Absolutely horrible. Forced subtitles. Good if required, but totally unnecessary for English speaking programmes."
"Kind of funny seeing all the bad reviews because it has certain content - it's a streaming service. It's meant to have lots of content and it's a good thing. If there's something you don't like, watch something else! Personally I've never had a technical issue with the service and I use it almost daily. There's a good breadth of content from movies to series and I definatley feel it's worth the price."
"I have 2 issues with netflix. 1) we pay money for it and the advert said new shows every month... Where? Are they invisible because new means 2020 mate not 1980.2) Why am I getting a NW-2-5 error report when everything else is working on the internet? How more stupid does an app have to be before it actually becomes decent? Cause mate you're miles off what you were like. Whoever updates the shows and movies needs to be fired today"
"Don't screw over  over the creators of Avatar and ruin the live action remake. Apologise and bring them back in the creative team. We won't stand for there mistreatment or your money grab insult to our franchise.Ohh also it was irresponsible to make 13 reason why  and the tiger king show. Both shows are harmful to society and your bad for doing. Fix avatar"
"The only reason you're getting one star is because of the very polite gentleman I spoke to over the phone after the worst online chat experience I've ever had. Unprofessional, typed lots of words but didn't explain anything and downright cheeky and rude. Awful, awful, awful customer service!!"
"I pay for the most expensive packages and yet it still hardly ever works. It's a joke I'll be watching a film and it will go off them start at 1% and go up by 1 every second then when it gets to 100% it comes up saying error. My internet if fine and i have no issues with anything else just Netflix. I'll be leaving Netflix soon and going to something better."
"We have been using Netflix for a while, however, from this February, we have been double charged every month, but we have only one subscription! So we contacted their customer service. They claim that there is another Netflix account has been using our bank info to have subscription. That account was not us! We have only one account on Netflix always. We asked them to refund the double charged months, they refused, saying that probably it is our own fault for clicking some phishing emails! But they have no evidence of sending us any email to warn for a new account using our bank info! Most likely someone hacked our account on Netflix and stoled our bank info to use for him/herself. We asked them to delete our bank info from that account, they said they did. Then guess what? The second day after, we got charged by Netflix again! We were so shocked, so contacted them again.... Apparently the same account or another account (they refused to tell us which one) has started to use our bank info again to pay for their own subscription! I mean seriously! The day before they promised that now our bank info and account is secure with them, and it didn't even last for more than one day! Now we are completely scared to have any information left with Netflix. They must have some secure loop in their system, but they refused to admit and fix it unfortunately. Instead, their strategy is to blame customers for such a loss. We are deeply disappointed on how they reacted and handled this case. We now asked them to delete any information of our account from their system (in Europe we have right to do so due to GDPR). Instead of doing it immediately, they asked us to send an application to some address and then they will deal with it within 20 days. Are you joking?! To subscribe, it is just a click; to quit, it is a hell of work for the customer! But we will do it anyway! Though they have lots of movies and series, so what, I am not willing to stay as a customer since I don't feel secure with my info anymore and they have not show respect to their customers as they should! So if you also use Netflix, pay attention to your bank transactions, coz you might be multiple charged!"
"What‚Äôs up with all this satanic garbage Netflix shoves in your face? This craps gotta stop. Literally a new show about satan or witches or just some messed up stuff is all I see here. What happened to the good ol days when happy Gilmore, dicky Roberts, black sheep, tommy boy, ect we‚Äôre what it was about. Disappointing Netflix, honestly you got a lot of dark crap on here. Y‚Äôall need Jesus."
"An other day of extremely disappointed !!!!!! Absolutely awful, nothing works again !!!!!!!"
"I'm always having fun and watching. Thanks!"
"Netflix makes it hard for me to find shows that interest me. The search function gives me things that are not of interest to me. They also make it very hard to find the list of things I'm watching, so I can go to the next episode. I have to scroll through all kinds of things that they recommend to get to my list of ""keep watching""."
"Okay. Here is my experience. I have found countless movies, ie; Parker starring Jason Statham, to mention just one, for FREE on Tubi TV but Netflix, a service I pay for, doesnt even carry it! This same exact situation happens with regular tv and movies that have been around for over 20 years, classics, that Netflix doesnt have but show over and over on regular tv and or on IMDB.TV, another free service! As far Netflix movie selections, there interface for browsing movies is horrific! They dont make it easy to see ALL of the movies they carry. If the""movie"" section is clicked on, you cant scroll through all of what they have. Maybe Netflix should take a tip from how cable guides set up their movie search capabilities! Still beats going the old school way of renting at Block Busters for convenience and price even though going to Block Busters used to be a blast and fun !"
"Netflix doesn't produce TV shows anymore. What Netflix produces nowadays is a pure propaganda. I miss the time when we were getting normal movies and TV shows in the past without political messages, movies made by heart, but nowadays it's all about politics and propaganda and Netflix became powerful tool for that. Just watch any movie produced in 90's and then watch Netflix movie produced in 2020. Difference is big. Netflix's most content is a pure far left wing & anti-white propaganda pushed & forced upon us. I'm really tired from this crap. Basically, they are doing what Nazi Germany was doing to Jews, just instead of physically destroying us, they are trying to do it with propaganda. We're living in the era of propaganda. World must wake up and stand up against discrimination from organizations like Netflix. The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that, there are some great TV series on Netflix like The Last Kingdom, Spartacus, Sons of Anarchy, Breaking Bad, House of Cards, Fargo, Dexter, The OA (which sadly got canceled)... And I'm also enjoying reality competition series like ""Top Chef"", ""The Final Table"", ""Glow Up"" and etc... I wish they had more content like these, instead of those political driven crap content..."
"Some of the dramas are great, as is some series.My only gripe is that many should be rated R++++A step below soft porn.The story line doesn't need all this horizontal positioning to be enjoyable. It's gotten to the point of being uncomfortable. In the Dark, How to Get Away with Murder, Shameless, to name a few.Humans are not rabbits. Please stop making them out as such."
"In other countries the content seems better but here in Australia there are too many things missing.We currently have 3 subscriptions (Netflix, Disney+ and Stan) and we're cutting down to 2, the whole family agreed that Netflix is the one to go.At the same time as missing content, the price keeps going up. Two shows that i thoroughly enjoyed were:Bojack Horseman and Black Mirror, I might come back if they make more episodes."
"The customer service isn't a customer service they can't open a case or take inquiries from customers. They only as they say ""take feedbacks""... Feedbacks the customer will never hear from again. With all the competitors the poor quality of their production without even talking about the movie curation ... This service is NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE. I am cancelling my subscription right now."
"Extremely arrogant obnoxious staff who accused me and my partner of lying about receiving an email from them re: changing Password. They implied we were at fault and not looking properly at the emails. We informed them we had not received the email on 9 occassions, over 2 days and using two seperate email addresses ( at their request ) to get info on how to change the password. Yes, we checked junk / trash box ). I asked for a transcript of our phone conversation as is my legal right and the arrogant Anastacia point blank refused my legal right. I then asked for a H.Q. address too send a complaint and she said they don`t have a complaints dept !. ... LOL.  She refused to give me an address. Apparently they `don`t have offices`. We are now having to cancel Netflix due to their incompetence to deal with this situation. They actually blamed hotmail.co.uk for the problem too. Anyone but them."
"Avoid if you dont want to damage your screen, black bars cause permanent image burn.Netflix say you need to turn your tv off and back on to get rid of bars , this is untrue because some movies full screen others black bars without turning tv off n on. Stream full format Netflix only good thing is i won claim at court because panasonic include netflix button on remote :)"
"Netflix SUCKS!!  We Loved watching several of the shows, one of which is ""Cursed"" which is only given one season!  I quit stupid Netflix for developing such an elitist status and thinking that they can do one or two seasons of amazing acting and just ditch them.  Cancelled my subscription. Go suck an egg Netflix."
"Nothing that can beat it. The shows on here are impeccable and better than those on anything else. Keep doing it great Netflix. (PUT COME FLY WITH ME BACK ON OR ITLL BE A ONE STAR!!"
"I think Netflix is really good but how about putting all the films which need subtitles and which are not in English in one section ,to make it more user friendly ,nothing worse than starting a film then realising you can‚Äôt understand it but good for stats for you ,as people start them films then switch them off ,maybe a section so we don‚Äôt waste are time starting films ,just a thought )"
"Please keep showing stuff like Kalifat. People have to learn about culture differences and educate themselves"
"I consider myself a connoisseur of comedy.  People vary in this a great deal.  There is silly humor, stupid humor, un-creative cheesy humor.  I like well develop characters and good plots as well as creative witty and situational humor.  I think the 80's were the best for funny movies.  Netflix is not serving up good comedies too often.  Some of Adam Sandlers comedies are good.  Does the protagonist get the girl at the end?  That is the usual measure for a comedy.  Every which way but loose, with Clint Eastwood,  he does not get the girl, but he gets his pet orangutan and it was very funny.  Harvey with James Stewart 1950 was great.  Very well written and yet Elwood did not get the girl at the end but his relationship with Harvey continued.  I hope Net flex will add more of the good comedies.  Less dark plots."
"Waited two years, yes two years for the season 2 of Umbrella Academy. How can you wait two years for ten episode of approximately 40 minutes and leave me like a pooh on the floor at the end. I think we give enough money to Netflix so stop to treat me like a pooh on the floor Netflix please be nice. GIVE MONEY BACK !!!! LOL"
"Poor streaming quality and tech support is s**t!!! 4 days of taking to agents on chat and 4 days of ‚Äúrestart your router‚Äù. Downdetector shows other reports of same issue but apparently it‚Äôs my fibre. Screw Netflix!!!"
"Lately weird with their black/LGBT whatever the hell propaganda. HBO GO is better."
"Love Netflix, kept my son and I happy through lockdown. Great movies, love the fact you have great cartoons such as Total Drama (please don‚Äôt get rid of that series, it‚Äôs the best !!) Home and Hotel Transylvania and Captain Under Pants all cartoon series. I‚Äôve been watching Netflix for years. Love it all !!!!!"
"Amazing for me, great choices of shows and a huge range of genres. What I like is that you receive an email from them updating you about new things that are coming out or out. Thanks Netflix"
"Since last week Netflix payment plataform is down, not accepting card updates. I've reached out to Neflix multiples times and informed what was happening. I suggested would be escalated to IT, my request was disregarded  and no solution was provided via chat or phone. Fast but inneficient support."
"They speaks about FREE trial, but actually they don't given unless your TV is NEW. So if you have 2nd hand TV and if the old user had a account with his own email id and new person login with new email id still you're not qualify for the trial free offer. It is NO where they mentioned and blindly they say offer. So whoever new to netflix simply register and expect for offer, but end of the day you won't get. And also, I feel like its kind of cheating new people who having old TVs"
"They used to have great customer service you could call 24/7.  Now they are always closed when you are home and wanting to deal with entertainment issues.  I've had a DVD on the Netflix mailing queue in #1 position for about three weeks that they just keep skipping over sending me. It says ""Long Wait"" but there is no notice of how long.  In the past they would ship an extra disc while waiting but now my queue seems irrelevant and they just skip discs that aren't available. Can't call them because they are always closed in the evening.  So annoying."
"Netflix got really unreliable. The quality is very sub par. Hopefully they can fix their problems soon.."
"Never used it once. Tried to sign-up for the free trial once while i was laid off and it said my card info wasn't right. Didnt have my card on me to find my error so figured it was my sign that i didnt need it. Surprise a month later i get billed? Oh now you have my card info right? Shady dirty tricks used on people that were laid off thru no fault of our own. Shame on you Netflix"
"Contacted Netflix as they had taken a payment from my bank twice and I asked for a refund. I thought it was a reasonable request (they didn't). I did finally get my refund only to discover that because I asked,they black listed my card. They now have the cheek to ask for another card to pay with. NO CHANCE. Will never subscribe to Netflix again."
"some of the films are only on specific countries systems which can be quite annoying because you have to pay for an extention for it"
"Netflex quality of programs has collapsed in recent months. recent duel agreements with others appear to be a reason. Overall it is definately heading in the wrong direction. Many are talking bout this. Time to flick the subscription"
"Netflix is a complete and utter waste of time and money - garbage."
"Netflix has got almost everything I want to watch. I consider my monthly fee as an investment rather than a spending."
"For a monthly fee of $7.99, I get endless entertainment. Variety of different genres, binge watching, and original shows. Who could possibly ask for more?! And no commercials! Never a problem, always there."
"Very expensive and not at all good. Though it works fantastic but the content is very adult."
"RACIST content! I love Netflix and enjoy using it however recently started watching Money Heist (a great show) which I found had some islamaphobic/racist content. The word terrorist which was the dubbed English was subtitled by Netflix as Jihadist. To clarify, I have no problem with the term jihadist being used when referring to actual jihadists - however jihadist and terrorist do not mean the same thing and should not be used synonymously/interchangeably. Not only is this racist and islamaphobic but it insights hate towards the muslim community. Watching this at home with my family us all feel attacked in our own home. I contacted Netflix regarding this (what I had hoped to believe was a) mistake via the online chat facility. I was told they had no power to do anything. I then contacted via a customer service number which was extremely difficult to find only to be told they could do nothing as their freelance translators are responsible. If this is the case I am amazed Netflix doesn't have quality controls in check to at the very least filter racist/sexist/homophobic content. As a major company in 2020 I find this appalling. Netflix should take responsibility for racist content on their platform and not shift responsibility for freelance workers."
"Terrible movie display.. put on van gelding, Gran Torino, gargoyles, X-men... any good original action films ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôèüèª God bless your souls"
"STAND BY LAWRENCE FOX.  BOYCOTT NETFLIX AND ANYONE ELSE WHO BOWS TO THE LEFT MARXISTS,  BLM AND WOKE BS.  'CANCEL' THEM FROM YOUR LIFE."
"I guess some people might think Netflix is great, but I don't. In order to find movies, you have to know the titles or be happy with the same ones they picked for you. Can't seem to search by actor either. I liked the old way where they listed every movie and that way I could read the description and decide to watch something new. I'll stick with Amazon Prime. Prime is cheaper and offers better selection and doesn't pigeon hole me into a few titles."
"I have had netflix's for over a decade and have loved every minute of it until today, when I needed customer service for the first time EVER. Because of Covid I am downsizing my life, and want to keep Netflixs but need to change the card it was being charged to. It wasn't a long wait until I was speaking to customer representative, Chris on 7/18/20 10:09 (Hawaii Aleutian standard time). First Chris could not look up the email account that I provided to him clearly and spelt it for him the first time he asked for it. He rudely asking for it and then rudely told me that was not the correct address. I told the email address two more times. Then, I went step by step as he asked me turn on Netflix on my TV and walked me to the info part that shows the address I had FIRST, originally gave him, the only email address I gave him. I counted that for a small mistake on his part and even though he did not take responsibility for not repeating back the email or clarifying the email on his end, or just plain getting it wrong, we pursued to the  next step where my husband had unfortunately changed his email password  (which is the email connected to Netflix that I needed access too). I asked Chris three different times if there was any other way to get into this account because my husband works nights shifts as was asleep.AGAIN Chris rudely told me that he HAD to send the email to THIS (my husbands) email only. So begrudgingly, I woke up my husband, who did not remember his new password off the top of his head as he sat up in bed, half asleep.  When coming back to tell Chris that wasn't an option,  my husband could not remember his new password, Chris said, ""Okay is there another email to send it to?""Of course there is! There is mine! I wish we had done that in the first place, which I had inquired about when I asked what our options are so I do not have to wake my husband. Chris said nothing. At this point I as soooo disappointed in Chris and Netflix's customer service.he sent this link  to my on my email address. When I  hit the link it took me to the log in Netflix page where I would be using  my email instead (which is fine just took sooooo long to get to this point when it didn't have to) I tried all of my passwords I could think of to log in. When none of them worked, I did ask, is this the password to my email? He said no it's the password to your Netflixs account! OMG. Is this guy forreal? I said then, it would have been nice to have be given that instruction. He says nothing. And has apologized for anything on his end for the long process that could have been done so much better with a helpful person and not a person that with his patronizing tone. Finally, 14 minutes later, I am at the point that I can see where to change my info. I am so irritated with how frustrating and difficult Chris made this for me that I asked to get off the phone and that I could take it from there. When the only time his was tone had changed into a positive one, when he told me to take my time as he wanted to make sure that  I would get the info changed. It was so shocking to me that he wanted to stay on the phone and his tone of voice had changed. Chris stayed on the phone and when he asked me if I had anymore questions, I just asked for his name. My husband later said I should have asked for a number of some customer service ID number. But I hadn't. I have NO idea why he was kind to me the last minute of the conversation. I guess he was trained to stay on the phone until what I wanted to be fix was fixed. Other than that, Netflixs please hire people that are helpful and kind. They have one job, to be helpful. And in the world we are living in, being kind goes a long way. Very sad to have talked to someone who made mistakes, dismissed my concerns, had me do things the long way, and talked to me in a condescending way, like I was an old lady that have never used technology before, when I am a 34 year old high school teacher that used technology my whole life and is advancing in the way I work with technology everyday of my career, to reach out, to relatem, and connect with my students daily. I hope I never have to call Netflixs again. Stay perfect out there people and try to figure it out YOURSELF before calling Netflixs."
"So bad it‚Äôs good - very lame and poorly produced Netflix original bunch bs crap 3/4 of the movies I wish to see is not Available  and never will be - you suck ass , plain and simple - I‚Äôm never wasting my GD money on useless bunch of Trite crap u ppl dish out :/ F U all !"
"Customer service non existent.Machine reply templates.Charged for a trial only to realized a month later despite asking for it to be cancelled a week after the start of the trialClaims a lot of people falls for the same marketing sham: Sign up for a 30 day free trial, but if by chance someone in your household used it before, you have to pay.And,there's no prompt. Just your bank charge appearing.Ethical? Hah what a joke.Guess I paid my lifetime worth of netflix subscription."
"Still scraping the bottom of the barrel for content it seems wouldnt mind but all there stuff is free to watch online without a subscription."
"Called customer service as I do not have Netflix but a charge of 5.99 has been taken from my account. No explanation to why , just a message to say it‚Äôs an unexplained charge. To rectify this they need to block my card from any future requests to open a Netflix account. Will only refund last three payments. Very unhelpful"
"Netflix is the best value service ever!In the UK I pay ¬£5.99 per month, and during the pandemic it has been an absolute godsend. Compare that to the fact that a UKTV licence is ¬£150 a year and the programs are crap!Okay some Netflix films are rubbish, and some are A bit dated, but the quality of some of the TV series is exceptional.BTW - If you get an email saying there is a problem with your login or for your payment, don‚Äôt click on anything but just delete it!!! Then log into your account and if all is normal you know it is a scam. Simple!Keep up the good work Netflix, who would want to pay for sky, Amazon or BT!"
"i would appreciate if netflix reduces it's subscription price."
"Best service with great movies and serials."
"I have had a mostly good experience with Netflix. When I have had an issue I have had to work harder with customer service to get the issue resolved than I think is necessary. A great selection of movies and shows there is always something to watch."
"Its aight. Meejum"
"Very nice online movie platform."
"Produces quality, original shows. Provides oldies but goldies movies from the past. Got no problem with the sharing subscription esp. if it's within the family."
"I seriously think that Netflix should not allow more than one person to share a person's subscription.   I think they would see many more subscription's and I seriously doubt the fee will stop people from using their outstanding package.   Plus sales and marketing along with stock growth would soar !!!"
"I am a customer from Jamaica...but I am really upset that season 16 of Grey's anatomy is not here as yet... I am asking please let it b available as soon as possible"
"Barry white service nothing I search for is on there I thought it had all movies sky.com has more online movies than you in their sky store etc why am I paying for you"
"Netflix is the most watched thing in our house but they only have seasons 4 and 5 of Steven universe. I would enjoy Netflix alot more if they had all the Steven universe seasons and episodes."
"Have been a happy customer for years until there was a problem where my account was compromised. Customer service is a joke and they refuse to help!"
"Have great programmes from my past which bring up good memories, just wish you could change the ‚Äúare you still watching‚Äù notifications as I need noise to sleep and I end up having to press yes just as I‚Äôm falling asleep, but that‚Äôs obviously my problem lol"
"Whats with the rating?Great app, using it daily to watch different movies and series, super good price for the services given!"
"This is one of the best apps I have on my devices.  It keeps me entertained each time I'm at the hospital or whenever I go on long trips.  I have other similar apps but this is my first choice as always."
"Try to sign up for Netflix. The system require to send text to my mobile to complete the process but keep pop up error after I enter correct info. Call Contact center they are not able to help and ask me to sign up again few days later. Awful service and definitely not recommend"
"I don't know what everyone is talking about their bad customer service. While I'm to first to notice and complain about bad customer service,theirs have been a very positive experience. My daughter and I got the same t.v.for Black Friday Phillips 65.We both cannot access Netlix.She has two other TV s and they are fine. Well back to customer service. Talked to two different women .They were both knowledgeable and polite.We still couldn't get it to work.Hoping upon hope still nothing.today I canceled."
"Abysmal selection.I have no interest in Far Eastern cinema or bad Bollywood horror that‚Äôs about as scary as my dog‚Äôs bowel movements. They axe anything of interest, the most recent being the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, & also do not give Uk customers access to their full catalogue. We got Netflix 4 years ago when we could not get any other service. Now will get rid of it next year, after they air the last part of Sabrina."
"I got Netflix thinking it was free trial for 1 month.2 days later a subscription was taken out of my bank.I got in touch with customer service & to cut a long story short they could not do a free trial in my Coventry area. I have a Email copy script that was discussed of Netflix actually saying this.?........How serious are NETFLIX it depends on your area haha.If you have a internet connection you get Netflix RIGHT.A FREE TRIAL is nothing to do with your area.Total ripoff."
"Netflix used to be good but when it started slipping in Foreign films that are dubbed in english or have subtitles WITHOUT informing the end user, that;s when I stopped using Netflix. I WANT TO KNOW IF THE MOVIE IF SELECTED IS A FOREING FILM. I have no interest in watching lousy foreign films that are made cheaply with lousy actors who can't act their way out of a paper bag. Amazon Pime does not do this. Netflix is on it's way out."
"Netflix had a bug preventing me from connecting to my account, I reported it and they didn't do anything about it for weeks, provided me no updates, and seemed to not care at all. I asked for the time to be refunded as I did not get the service I was paying for and they refused. I cancelled my service. I loved their product but their customer support policies are terrible."
"Had my details stolen, couldn't access netflix and they didn't want to help!"
"Just joined netflix. What a massive con. They have more 'films related to' than the real films. The films made by netflix are really low budget crap with titles close to the blockbusters that you really want to watch. I put into search 35 blockbuster titles i.e. top gun, titanic, joker, the battle of Britain etc to name a few , guess what ? None of the 35 were available. To top the lot the first film it relates to when entering joker (which is a physiological thriller) was a peppa pig cartoon or did they mean peppered pig?  Either way Netflix is an absolute joke, don‚Äôt go near it you‚Äôll get the same content on your cheapest cable channel. Its not going to be too long before no one subscribes to anything on line any more."
"Poor offer always the same thing over and over again don‚Äôt have all the translation, you have an error message very often Not worth the money"
"Customer service is  terrible they don't care one bit about you or your issue. No option to escalate issue. I spoke to two members of staff and after over 2 hours as I reliased they don't care even when I sent them evidence of my cancelled account and a screenshot of my account status on the day I did it. They still wouldn't refund me. I will never use such a dishonest company agian."
"Great streaming service, but their customer service is terrible. Just had my first experience; online chat just repeats what is on the website, either an AI, or someone just reading from a script. No option elevate the complaint to someone more senior, felt well and trully fobbed off!!!"
"Beyond pissed with this corporate virtue signalling nonsense to the woke rage mob. Now we're forced to have Black Lives Matter categories. No one except for radical morons with no brains supports those terrorists and I certainly don't want to have to look at anything BLM related while I am trying to watch a series or a movie with a service that I am paying for."
"After watching the movie Twice about an elderly man who survived two atomic bombs and seen hell on earth.Netflix recommends me a movie with 40's anti Japanese war propaganda contradicting what the movie Twice was about.The recommendation I've received came after i clicked on the movie Twice and looked at similar movies.I find it highly disturbing that Netflix algorithm allows these kind of combinations.But what i find more disturbing is that i cant get a solid answer from support if i ask if in two weeks the recommendation is removed.Extremely distasteful"
"Three star, because i cannot find many of the movies many of the times that I really wanna watch. That is pretty sad and bad :("
"I like Netflix but I hate how many shows they can just take off. It‚Äôs so unfair to so many people."
"Please avatar Korra in Netflix Switzerland xD"
"Netflix has good content with high quality image at a decent price. Nothing to say about that.However, I think they are getting a bit fat and don't serve the costumers as they should be.There is a serious problem with scammers that try to get your bank details via email using Netflix name. Netfilx does nothing about that unfortunately.I receive at least 20 spam emails per month, asking bank details, from so called ''Netflix'' which I find unacceptable. How do these guys know that I have an account with Netflix?I don't know whether to close my account and open a new one or just do nothing? It does not feel safe at all.Guys you put people's bank accounts at risk, please do something to tackle these spam emails."
"netflix australia is not streaming 5.1 or dolby digital plus.   Netflix documentation says ‚Äú Titles that have 5.1 surround sound available will display either a Dolby Digital Plus icon or a 5.1 icon on the movie description page.‚Äùthere is not one single title that shows this insignia.  The call centre talked around in circles, and would not acknowledge the problem, and kept focussing on other things. Disappointing."
"Great service! Good support. Such a good app, using it daily!"
"I don't understand how / why this is rated so poorly on here?! It's a brilliant service. I'm late to the party (only started using it last year) but I continue to be amazed by it."
"Old boring films and tv shows to watch. And if you did find a tv show to watch not all the seasons were on their. So wasting my time when it's not complete. Also the main thing that made me cancel my subscription was lack of security to protect my account. My account was hacked and was being used in Colombia and the language setting was changed from English to Spanish. When contacting Netflix about this I was told that it's my fault the account got hacked and told me to have my security updated. Which it was hense why I got notifications that my account was being used in a different country and my account changed. Very poor service. They were no help and very quickly put the blame on their customers.. managed to sort my account out with no help at all from Netflix! Been a valid customer for 4 years, and now I can not trust you to look after your customers."
"Need more movies ,like old ones plus more action pack one"
"Love netflix but not in love with their customer service. The guy couldnt help me at all and I believe their live chat automatically exits if there arent any replies within a certain amount of time (which is VERY inconvenient since their side takes quite a while to reply). Ive attempted live chat 3 times now and each time their rep was unhelpful AND it kept exiting randomly. If I could I‚Äôd give this customer service a 0/5."
"Netflix said it was a free trial month then charged my credit card even though I canceled the 1st week."
"Get a house account as it would be a lot cheaper. Good shows in English, Spanish and Korean but I am still waiting on when they expand further into other languages."
"Horrible for watching animes!!The subs are just horrible, did they used google translator or something??"
"Happy to have Netflix with me during the pandemic. I work at home on a graveyard shift and watching through Netflix always keeps me awake."
"I don't even want to give it one star for 3-months I can never watch anything on Netflix they keep saying it's my telly when I had it on my laptop and phone and doing the same thing when I ring up there very rude then will never give me a manager everywhere I can Netflix are the worst company to ever go with don't go with them"
"The best streaming service, I am very happy"
"I like how some of their movies and TV series are good and some that are repulsively bad. I really hate how they always cancel TV series I happen to like a lot."
"If you want to watch Netflix on multiple screens, be ready to cough up more money. If you want to watch HD videos, Netflix will again charge more money. Amazon Prime Video is so much better. Netflix is too expensive for multi screen HD video options. No such restrictions on Amazon Prime Video."
"I accidentally scratch the code of my Netflix card. They were so quick and helpful in this situation. The issue was resolved less than 5 minutes. I didnt have to wait for them to reply back to me."
"Movies are so old and they were not very good when they were first released!Searching for anything decent will drive you to insanity and back.It really is not worth even $10 a month."
"Great since it allows me to watch movies, but how come it advertises a free first month but it is suddenly not available in my country. My friend was able to get the promo and when it wad my turn to register, it was unavailable."
"I mean it's alright but not much selection and the originals are usually always rubbish."
"A lot of choice, great quality movies and series, worth what it cost."
"They provide a good service and lot more shows, but it is too costly afford for a common man."
"I heard some of the people says that their account was used by other people they don't know, BUT that did not happen to me. I am giving NETFLIX 5 stars which they totally deserved. Netflix helped me during all those boring days when I was pregnant. And now, since I am already a mom with a 27 month old toddler, everyday is filled with joy, playful yet physically tiring activities. Netflix helped me sane during this period. Watching movies is my great hobby and I know NETFLIX will always be the best APP for movies."
"Cancelled my subscription as you have no content. Why are you still charging me?"
"Netflix is today a poor platform for third hand movies and TV shows that nobody wants to watch!There are far better alternatives, even for free online!As ex Netflix customer i declare myself stupid for paying for these tv services!In 2020 Netflix looks more and more like a SCAM."
"I love it!Netflix is something im spending my evenings with. I love the choice of movies and series, I love how easy and price worthy it is, always adding up all the best new shows. I watched Friends and How i met your mother 100 times, just because it is so convenient, you open everything with the press of a button. Also love the fact that you can have a choice of movies to download, used it a lot while traveling. I am using an Iphone so it is difficult for me to find the proper app for watching movies I want offline. Netflix solved my problem! Recommend!!!"
"Rude and useless. Instead of helping the agent was trying to find fault on my side...the paying customer! unreal! account on hold due to non payment...tried 5 different, fully funded cards and non worked....and the issue is my end?! after 20 min chat they realised it was a problem their....canceling membership...!"
"Netflix customer service suck I spoke to a customer service agent today his name was Tony......he was not helpful at all I've been a loyal customer with Netflix for years and I got treated so unfair......I am jus gonna take my business to Hulu......."
"The best way to spend some quality time with my family in this lockdown is just watching some good old and new movies with them on Netflix. It made our life a little less boring and the best thing of all, there is no end of movies there. I really appreciated having it this time around."
"After an evening in lockdown with my lovely husband, an evening of high expectation was dashed after finishing the first 8 episodes of The Medici. Dear oh dear Netflix. What a shambles of an operation your customer service operation is.  An evening and morning  ruined trying to find episode 1 of Season 2 of The Medici and contacting the help chat room to no avail as the slow operative stumbled and fumbled about in the dark.  I waited and rang Netflix help this morning. After half an hour I had got no further. The woman I spoke to was hopelessly ill equipped to assist, asked many many questions and kept on asking me to be patient as she went away , leaving me waiting, only to do -  absolutely nothing! She was unfamiliar with the series. There is nowhere else to contact. Nowhere to write. I see the COO of Netflix  is Rachel Whetstone, a cls-confessed Conservative libertarian  (like Johnson) and married to Steve Hilton!  Well. Good luck with that one then Netflix.  As there is no technical support and hopelessly inadequate customer care, there is nowhere for customers to go but to leave Netflix entirely."
"I love Netflix! I watch movies almost every night and it's been great so far, especially during quarantine! However, I have been feeling a little lonely watching so many movies by myself at home. I wish there was a way that I could watch movies with friends from home."
"The streaming service when working is top notch however its been a while since I lve experienced genuinely rude and condescending unhelpful call centre service. I hope I was just unlucky"
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. DOUBT IF THEY UNDERSTAND ENGLISH AT ALL. MY NETFLIX DOESNT WORK ANYMORE THEY ONLY REACT TO MY MESSAGES WITH AUTOMATED REPLIES TELLING ME TO DO STUFF I ALREADY DID A HUNDRED TIMES. WHEN I SAY SO THEY JUST KEEP REPEATING IT. ANNOYING AF!! AND THE SERVICE FOR WHICH I PAY STILL DOESNT WORK. WORST WORST WORST COMPANY"
"Good range of films and programmes, but having purchased 4K Ultra HD TV disappointed to see how much Netflix charge to watch in this format. Twice as much as Disney and Prime who both include 4K in their standard package."
"Nothing new all old film when is Netflix going to put more  up to date films on shame on u netflix"
"Programming is ok. The Netflix shows I find to have bias in them, or are not as historically correct as portrayed. That being said....I just got off the phone and am speechless!!! As a customer of several years, I have had one device, two, and back and forth. I was shocked to hear they NEVER ADJUSTED MY PAYMENTS!!!!!! I have been paying for two devices since the beginning!!! I don‚Äôt do bank statements but trust and believe that I will be checking my balance!!!!"
"Started getting an error message telling me to turn off my VPN. I don't have a VPN. Contacted Netflix, who were no help and told me to contact my ISP. I did and they were great, but the problem is not at their end. Netflix have mistakenly blacklisted my IP and can't be bothered to fix it. I already had Amazon Prime and just caught the cheap Disney+ deal so it's not like I'm short of options. Just going to leave Netflix. Not worth the hassle for the two decent shows per year."
"Quantity over quality, and when you do find quality, it is overwhelmingly liberal woke garbage, pass the bucket. What started out as a sound idea, became a lefty ideal. Will not be rejoining."
"Customer service are incompetent and rude. Never used Netflix in my life never had an account with them. Someone got my card information and was charging a 15.99  monthly fee until I caught it and reported Netflix. I use paypal on everything I do online except for work related transactions. Contacted Netflix the man was an idiot. I asked who was using my card information under what account. He wouldn't tell me and when I asked why he couldn't give me an answer. He said he cant tell me who is charging my card to them. He kept asking me for my email and account info when I clearly said I do not have one with them. He had an attitude and was not helping. Completely incompetent employee. I asked to speak with supervisor and was hung up on. I finally got a hold of another manager and he said the same thing. I had them put a block on my info. That is all I got. NO respect, no apology. NO information regarding who was charging my card. They are clueless. I know of others who stopped using Netflix due to hacked accounts which is a whole other problem. Not safe to give them your info and not a company that should be supported. Unprofessional and backwards."
"I have had Netflix for some time. I have found them very good. They have films and series which we cannot get on the normal channels. It was been great as we can see series that is not on terrestrial channels. So, during lock up this has been great for me and the wide and family"
"Loved watching Come Fly With Me but as it‚Äôs been taken off I have no choice but to cancel me‚Äô subscription, may the lord smite thee down."
"It's a good service but not up to date with the films. Don't believe you get a month free, it's a con and they're can't be trusted then give you any lie to avoid the free period."
"Censorship is not a badge of a TV service you can trust. I watch TV to relax not to be told what I should and shouldn't find funny by people who have no right to make that judgement."
"Netflix removed ""Little Britain"" due to the latest George Floyd racism debate. What a hairbrained b*llsh*t!What's next? Delete all Monty Python movies from all channels because they are not politically correct?Insanely stupid.Have cancelled my Netflix subscription and will NEVER EVER subscribe again!"
"Netflix used to be very good, but given recent decisions made by the company I will not be returning to the service. I cannot get on board with kneejerk censorship or pandering to the mob."
"Have been a long standing member for over 7 years now and honestly have never actually had to reach out to customer support until today. I am now truly contemplating whether I should keep the service given the lack of content and extremely rude and unprofessional customer service. I was unfortunately matched with a rep we will call M. M was rude from the jump but I tried to remain cordial. They were very short and as I explained that my primary bank would return the payment due to an investigation going on after I had my banking info stolen, M spent some time typing what seemed like a long helpful response only to send me ""so do you want me to update your info or what?"". I was too agitated with their lack of customer service from the time that they entered the chat room that I simple responded letting them know that they were rude and unprofessional. I ended the chat and just went to do something else. Netflix has been sending me emails and updates to try and remedy the issue for almost two hours now almost as if to fix the terrible service given by M. Idrk, just a guess. If I choose to keep the service I WILL NOT be reaching out to their terrible chat support if I can help it."
"Extremely angry that 'unlimited' movies and TV actually means Netflix bows to current mob mentality and becomes 'restrictive' in removing certain British comedies..  So, Netflix subscribes to being dictatorial about what I am allowed to watch based on the package I PAY for and THEIR JADED, DISCRIMINATORY opinions that they're forcing upon me . SHAME ON YOU NETFLIX for jumping on the bandwagon and missing the whole point?  Speaking of which, why isn't White Chicks, Coming to America and Norbit banned for similar, Netflix???"
"Love Netflix! If I have a problem the costumer service resolves very quickly and they are amazing."
"I just tried to update my payment ard detials, as I have received a new card. The system won't let me do this and kept reverting to my old card. When I called Netflix, my account was blocked because of too many attempts to change the card details and I was told I now have to wait for 24hrs until I can try again! There is nothing they can do in the meantime. What a customer unfriendly system. I am now thinking very hard why I should renew Netflix and rewar them for their awful customer service/IT system."
"We just got Netflix. The content (some of it at least) is great. We're watching the beautiful and hilarious 'After Life' by Ricky Gervais.However, the Netflix interface is horrible and clunky. At the end of 'After Life' for example, the titles roll and some emotional music plays and then BOOM! it's rudely interrupted as the next episode loads. This happens with every series style production on the Netflix platform.So, I thought I'd complain, but you cannot email them, there is no web form. All you can do is phone them or do 'live chat'. I tried the live chat but the agent kept insisting that 'no one was available and what did I want to ask?' The company is so damn arrogant the only reason they believe you would ever want to contact them is to ask a question.So, nice content, shame about the clunky interface!"
"Take off Little Britain as racist, the most ludicrous decision ever. The show poked fun at everyone, this is how China deal with there problems, state control, shame on you Netflix, absolute disgrace!!!!!!!!!!"
"Used to be good before they went ""woke"" and banned original comedies to produce unfunny generic bland lifeless souless turds of Tv shows.  If ypu like comedy to not join 'wokeflix'"
"Little Britain and come fly with me need to come back to the UK Immediately"
"Very disappointed to learn they have taken the best COMEDY on tv off air due to the black life matter campaign. This program has nothing to do with racism and I find it annoying that people take this decision based on a minority and the customers don‚Äôt get a say ."
"Love Netflix! However they take films off every now and then and I'm currently wanting to watch Peter Pan however it isn't available in UK Netflix? But it is in the Egyptian Netflix? Please put Peter Pan back on the British Netflix as I am dying to watch it thank you!"
"I am recieving error 2.119 alot latly. According to the internet they are working on it. After a few weeks of this error I whend on their support chat. I am dutch speaking so the represantetive of netflix was a dutch speaking person aswell. Great i thouth. Until i started to conversate with the blunt and arrogant person. When I told him my main issue. That i am mostly on the raod and i download my episodes at home. When this error occurs the only solution that works is removing all downloads. But as you may or may not know some series have a download limit of 1. So when explaining that i never had watchd those episodes and if their was a solution or some kind of compensastion this person told me ""You can always go away from netflix"". I was stumpd and he kept going on without giving me one shred of customer support that you would expect from a company of this size. After 10-15 minutes of chatting with this idiot i asked to speak to his chief. I never got put through. He plainly ignored me for more than 10 minutes without putting me threw. I was fed up with waiting so i left the chat and asked for a log (never recieved it). But i have a copy paste in word! I wonder why their is no supervision of the customer chat and why i can not contact a supervisor of service staff like this."
"I dont think there is enough selection to convince for membership. I ll try Amazon."
"What is going on with Netflix?  There was a time when you could watch some great movies.  Now, practically everything are tv shows and/or series with various seasons. Then there are a ton of movies with subtitles.  I really feel the quality and quantity of movies (although limited) has gone down hill. I will be looking for an alternative."
"I don‚Äôt understand the reviews of people saying it worked for a while then stopped is that not internet provider problem.  I have never had issues like that but I must say the content of Netflix is boring and I recommend if you start to watch something that‚Äôs a series of seasons please google it to check that next season hasn‚Äôt been cancelled because Netflix seem to air series that don‚Äôt have season 2 or 3 etc because they have been Axed why air them then.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Netflix there‚Äôs no good content to watch"
"Great quality players. Good image quality."
"My account got hacked so many times here (more than 5 times). And when I contacted the customer services about this, they'll just tell me to change the password. They never really improved their security system!!! Only if someone makes the watching website like Netflix, I swear I won't use it anymore!!!"
"Pretty good and fast to be honest, there are room for improvement."
"It will work for a while and then stop. Tech support don't really pay attention to what you say. After turning the two devices that don't work off and on again, they blame the telco. Telco of course says not on their end. Works fine on my home network on other devices. The TV Netflix app shows internet connected, server 1 connected, server 2 not connected and server 3 connected, and the computer browser can't even get to the log in phase. Miraculously it may begin working again after several days before failing again further on."
"I do not understand these bad ratings for netflix, I think it is one of the best video streaming services out there. Great content and they upload a lot of new things"
"Uncomfortable and inappropriate content within children's programmes. Since 2020 has hit Netflix has started putting homosexual characters in every children's TV series, this makes my cls and my children extremely uncomfortable. If the programs had homosexuality right at the beginning than we would just choose to not watch the programme but they never do they wait until you have invested time into a seires. Whatever relationships you wish to have behind closed doors as long as it is legal and not causing harm to anyone it is up to you but I do not want it shoved down my throat, trying to normalise certain behaviours.Most people find homosexuality on their TV screens uncomfortable. It is against alot of peoples beliefs and I do not condone people harming or being cruel to people of a homosexual preference as I believe hate the sin love the person.Due to this constant content we are currently discussing to leave Netflixs."
"The security is non-existent. My husbands card has been used for Netflix without him even ever having an account with Netflix. They have been charging him for 8 months but only managed to refund 6 !I am also having very similar situation at the moment. I have cancelled the free trial before it even ended but noticed that Netflix is still charging my account. I have contact them but all they could do, refer back to the bank and PayPal. They managed to refund 2 unauthorised transactions out of 5 in total. They kept saying they cannot help me any further even though they have confirmed that they noticed suspicious activity on the account which by the way was closed by me!!! I would never trust them with any of bank or card details."
"My account was compromised.  Closed account reopened.  Then reopened by fraudster.  They would only refund one month though they saw fraudulent activity going back.  Totally inadequate."
"Quality during lockdown is horrific. I have complained about the quality a few times and been ignored every time. Blamed it on my internet speed or other devices on at the time. Internet speed is very fast, no other devices on and still the quality is absolute rubbish. May as well just throw ¬£11.99 down the drain every month. The sooner we find a better provider the better"
"Series are good,I like it."
"people are complain about netflix. just a remainder, you pay so little for so much and for a family/ group, not just a single subscription. 5 stars!"
"Me and my family watch Netflix a lot- good series and films. I think they could update with more/ better content as after a while you‚Äôve watched all of the good films on there. Also there seems to be quite a large gap between series being on tv and on Netflix (series like Brooklyn 99 and Dynasty)"
"Very poor offer, if you are a movie lover it can be a bit disappointing."
"Netflix for UK market is definitely with a very poor offer lately. There are some good series and films, however, new stuff comes very late and in very small amounts.Looking into the competition, they are updated with new great stuff much better and I'm thinking of leaving Netflix and joining other providers, as well as when using the application, quite often comes to the message that there was an error and suddenly screen stops working, including that internet connection and tv are working normally.You need to provide better service with more fresh stuff and not only collect money because you'll have a bigger loss in time. I'm not the only one who shares that opinion, my friends are talking the same way.Think about it."
"Use it so much, cant really complain"

I'm not the only one who shares that opinion, my friends are talking the same way.Think about it."
"The options for new series and movies are boring and most likely from Spain, Mexico or old movies I've seen three series like Versailles, Lucifer and Good Witch where some seasons were with audio in Spanish and all the sudden other seasons  were in English only Whoever manages the selection is very unprofessional They don't look like they care about customers opinions"
"Love Netflix to be honest! Can't beat a Netflix and Chill with my girls or bae."
"Though Netflix has a wide variety of movies, great original series etc., I wish they had better customer service. TWICE in a month they cancelled my subscription without any prior notice. First time I thought it was by mistake and simply paid one more time. It happened so that when they cancelled it second time, I changed my bank account and had to deal with my previous bank to get the money. I wrote to the help centre and the reply was shoking ""Sometimes we cancel accounts which show strange activity...."" There was NO unusual activity at all and when I asked what was meant by that, I got no clear answer. So apparently Netflix decides for you whether you're strange or not and cancels your account without any prior warning. Alright, maybe you don't want me as a client, but MAYBE you can make a refund on another card"
"This is a great platform with really good quality films and TV shows. There are many shows that are great and the subtitles never go out of sync with the video, whereas platform Now TV does which is extremely annoying. Netflix has multiple categories to watch from and the price is reasonable for what you are getting. The only down side is that occasionally there is buffering. However, this may be due to my WIFI (but my WIFI is normally pretty good so it's not likely to be that.)"
"Gets boring really quickly and doesn't have that great a selection either. On top of that the sound on almost every movie sucks. To hear people I have to turn my tv to 100 then once music or something happens it has to be turned down to 12 because it's insanely loud. It's not like that on my cable. So on top of that you can only watch on 2 tv/phones at once...so for the crappy subscription you have to pay more if you want to use it for 3 people. Rip off waste of money. They play all the same movies played on cable. Everytime I see a movie on Netflix it's on tv and I'm like why did I pay for this again? Take your money and go to wal mart and buy the cheap movies like Netflix does. The difference is the cheap ones are better at Wal Mart and they don't disappear after a month or two. You'll keep the move and eventually after a year have all the movies you want that are good and never pay anyone else a cent. Screw these places. Let's all buy dvd and screw then over!! Down with high priced crappy programming!!"
"After years of paying for Netflix I‚Äôve just realised how rubbish it actually is !! Now Tv much better !!"
"Netflix is great to have,  but very poor customer service on chat mode, spoke to me like i was a mate not very professional nor helpful,  my bill was due 3 days after the 22nd may, when i made sure funds where in there, but was taken late on 27th 2020 when i had no funds inn. He said it was down to my bank,  but i checked with the bank and it states payment went out on the 27th may 5 days after, the website claims its taken a few days after which is 3 days . No help at all kept thobbing me off and chatting slang awful service"
"Easy to navigate. Prices keep going up and shows keep getting pulled so that‚Äôs a negative. It‚Äôs just getting worse and worse through the years. Might end my subscription to it soon."
"Brilliant. Been watching some of my favourite old shows as well as some outstanding Netflix originals. Managed to get a special deal with Sky also so am happy about that in the current circumstances!"
"Excellent service for movie lovers. I often watch movies and TV shows there. I like the fact that on Netflix you can find movies that are not freely available in the Internet. They have a huge selection of movies and series for everybody. Recommend!"
"Netflix has been causing people's computers to freeze for years, and they are well aware of the issue. It's on their help page.Customer service is a joke - told me it's an issue with my PC, despite it being a known issue, and when I pointed this out, they told me to cancel my subscription.Useless, largely unusable service and appalling customer service."
"Great execution, great idea. Netflix is pretty good, they have a variety of shows,  and they have a audience of all ages, that makes it easier to find the show i want to watch, so overall netflix is pretty good."
"Awful content in the UK don't understand when the US version is so much better.Content released during vivid has been next to non existent. Awful!"
"I‚Äôve had a Netflix account for years - their own content has drastically improved the service and is a good price. It was a life saver travelling around the world with it being compatible all over. My only gripe is that Netflix in other countries is better than UK version with far more content and often newer films."
"Need more selection, works well on hisense smart tvs, native 4k content is good but should be included in the lower price. Need more accounts on family plan"
"Netflix seems to gear all its content with violence and low family morals. Even the movies in the faith and spirituality are violent. Netflix belongs to satan. Less than one star is more appropriate."
"I like Netflix so much because it provides a lot of variety of TV shows and movies. I love Netflix originals so much because they can only be seen on Netflix and they are very interesting. That‚Äôs legal because I pay for it and respect content owners. I would never commit online piracy because I want actors and actresses to get paid more. Thank you, Netflix! You are the best!"
"I typically have to dig around for great movies from the past just because the first ten or twenty rows are Netflix's new releases. They say it's because that's the type of content I watch but it's simply all Netflix stuff."
"Life saver during qurantine! Thanks netflix for having my back you the real OG"
"I really recommend Netflix since it has so much good movies/series but I am really disappointed because they also remove really good films like Twilight, Pretty little liars e.ct. But overall it is a really good app to watch shows for ¬£10 (monthly) so I do recommend it!"
"Netflix customer care executives are really ruthless/worst, I cancelled my account before end of billing cycle but still they charged my card and clearly refused to refund me the amount."
"As usual binge watching. Netflix is my only entertainment now!"
"As time goes by, Netflix seems to be worsening. At first, we could write and rate their movies, now it's only either thumbs up or down. The selection has also become lousier. E.g., during Easter Season, I could not find any movie that was put up to celebrate the Easter theme. The company has also become less family friendly. What on earth are the people at Netflix thinking trying to promote drugs with their latest documentary, ""Have a good trip adventures in psychedelics"". There are more and more programs on sex and drugs. I think the corporate leaders at Netflix are screwed. I am planning to unsubscribe. I'd rather be spending my time learning or doing something productive than screwing my mind with this crap. Keep Netflix away from your kids or at least do not allow them to watch a movie without your approval."
"Facts:  Netflix has been double billing me for my services since before  April  2017.  They bill once in the middle of the month and once at the end of the month.   I contacted Netflix when I realized I was being billed twice a month for my account.  I had an online chat for this.  This whole thing is such joke and Netflix are crooks.  I asked for a refund for the double billing and they told me they could only give me six credits.  I have been billed in error since before 2017 and they are going to give me $95 dollars when it is closer to $500.  I asked to speak to a manager and they said there is  no such thing.  There is no one else I can talk to.  They told me to reach out to paypal for a refund.  I did that and paypal said I had to reach out to my bank.  My bank said I had to go through paypal.  I am truly in the middle of a mess Netflix created.  I have never been treated so poorly after being robbed.  DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICE, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION."
"Cancelled but my wife complained as not finished watching The Crown so Wenger back in and the auto put me on the highest payment , went straight in to chang but being charged for a whole month, for four screen , I only need 2 but was not asked to confirm my order. Robin Hood was an outlaw these people are on another level . Be very careful."
"Netflix kept charging me although i asked them to cancel my membership.they have debited me 4 months for free, and Now i am asking them for full refund back to my Paypal account if you willing to refund me then this will be considered sloved.I Wonder why those big companies are doing this to us?JUST AS CONSUMMER KEEP IN MIND THAT WE HAVE A POWER THAT WE CAN USE AGAINST THEM IF THEY WANT TO ABUSE US. WHICH IS OUR BRAIN AND SITES LIKE TRUSTPOLIT WHICH SPEAK OUT OF TRUTH"
"I had Netflix in the United States and here in my home country and they haven‚Äôt disappointed me so far"
"There is just never anything to watch on netflix. Usually they have one good show so I‚Äôll renew my subscription but it‚Äôs never worth it. I cancelled a few month ago and won‚Äôt be renewing unless big changes are made."
"When a new cool show appears, I'm renewing my subscription. After 1-2 days when I finished watching the show, I'm closing my subscription ;) I don't know...seems like there is not enough content or me...But 1 cool show per month is still a cool result! Keep going!"
"A lot of slow boring movies that obviously nobody wanted or flopped so ended up on Netflix. Cheap for netflix to aquire is my guess. The odd top movies are in there. The series of Programs are much better viewing. Is it worth the subscription fee? Probably not seeing as most movies are currently shown on TV."
"I've had Netflix since the early days of DVD mailers and I've always enjoyed the low cost while still being able to see the newest releases. I still watch Netflix on a regular basis and have no problems with the Roku app. They come out with so much content that I can only imagine there's something for everyone on there. The only thing I don't like is how Netflix makes recommendations for you. It seems like the vast majority of content on the main page is made by Netflix. I get that, but there are so many studios making great movies, and you kind of miss out on those with Netflix. I typically have to dig around for great movies from the past just because the first ten or twenty rows are Netflix's new releases. They say it's because that's the type of content I watch but it's simply all Netflix stuff. It doesn't take much to realize that they're primarily promoting their own content, creating a less desirable user interface in the process.  Anyway, I still like Netflix."
"I enjoy the Netflix content and, as a family, we all enjoy different shows and something for all of us.  Some of the content is old and some newer and some I have never heard of so it is a welcome view in this day and age."
"Use it all the time! So much to watch, new and old. Even cancelled sky TV and just have Netflix plus a couple others now. Great service."
"My email was hacked and all my accounts were accessed and passwords changed. Netflix handled this very professionally and helped me with all the recoveries with my old account, transferring it on a new email and ensuring that all my previous watch history was on. Really happy with all the service and support"
"Subtitles Subtitles Subtitles It is a joke, most things l turn on on Netflix are subtitled now, I was looking forward to watching white lines  and when I turned it on it had subtitles so after 20 minutes turned it off, and iam sick of paying Netflix evey month and having to read when i just want look at a film/series, if I wanted to read Id go to the library, CANCELLING my account and try another company They really need so competition in this area Netflix is RUBBISH"
"I had an experience with someone creating a Netflix account with my card details which I had no knowledge off (fraud), only found out when looking at my card statement.I had an online chat with Effie from the Netflix team via the Netflix website and within 5 minutes the account had been found and cancelled. So efficient, helpful, and concise. Really great customer service!"
"The VAST majority of the titles are straight to DVD, third tier garbage that nobody is interested in watching. It's there just to pad their titles so it seems like they have a lot of content, which actually makes your experience worse. You have to sift through all the garbage to find the decent films. They've invested a heavy amount of money into their own TV shows, the majority of which are terrible. Some aren't bad, but it's not enough to justify it. The worst part of it is THEY WON'T STOP ASKING IF YOU'RE STILL WATCHING. Hulu doesn't ask. Amazon doesn't ask. There's not even a option to pay for this feature to go away. It's just a giant pain that nobody likes. Seriously, besides the minimal amount of programming that's watchable, I have zero reason to recommend this service."
"I feel like reducing all my other reviews to 4 when it comes to Netflix just so its 5 stands out. It began offering so much at such a moderate price that i quickly became a loyal subscriber. Breaking Bad... Worth every penny alone...Austerity hit, perks went, Netflix politely froze my subscription, but I quickly realised the value and resubscribed. Fast forward a lot of years to present day Covid and I check my Nan and Grandad account and throughout lockdown a couple of isolated non techy old age pensioners in Lundon have understood my brief explaining of how to get onto my account and have smashed through every episode of the Lost Kingdom. I see this from many miles away up North in the Danelaw. Heartfelt thanks Netflix. And I mean it."
"They have some good items to watch.The problem I have with netflix is I had a previous account with them and closed the account and stopped payment from my bank account. A month later I opened a new account with a different Bank account with netflix. BUT to my surprise  going back on bank statements I noticed for over 18 months that they were still taking money out of the old account.When I contacted netflix, I was fed with a load of excuses (bull....) and not offered any help or money back and told to contact my bank... My bank said netflix should repay the money back as I cancelled the contract with them ü§îü§î.Still waiting to hear back from netflix üò¥üò¥"
"Way better than Hulu, but lacks in variety of good choices."
"Some good films but they are increasingly choosing to release foreign films with English dubbing which doesn‚Äôt make for the best watch."
"I have been a victim of fraudulent Duplicate accounts with netflix who took over 80 pound from my account over a 6 week period. When I raised this with them they said they had flagged a duplicate account, but they didn't do anything about it.  I closed my account and they confirmed they would refund me the charges.  Having waited for over a month I am now told they will only refund ¬£15 of the 80 as it's their policy. Still not got my refund which they hold onto for weeks. What a shameful way to treat customers . I will never use them again and if I were you , keep a check on your account as they dont accept responsibility for their poor securityNow 3 months on and still no refund"
"I have the 2 DVDs plan and the turn around time is so slow. I mail it on. Thurs and don‚Äôt get one back until the following wed. Not worth the 14 bucks a month. The lady I spoke to at customer service was very rude also.  I been a member for 10 years and she wouldn‚Äôt even budge on sending an extra one out for one time, to make up for the long wait. I use to get them a day later now it‚Äôs a week. Not sure what happened. Getting ready to cancel!"
"Netflix is so coool! So many great series and so much choice!! Loved breaking bad as well as sons  of anarchy but my all time fave so far is the last kingdon.so much so i have bought the entire book collection!!currently gripped by designated survivor.this programme is so well acted and kiefer sutherland in the main role with natascha mcelhone as first lady is inspired!!!rapidly becoming my all time fave!!! Please keep them coming and i will keep on watching!!"
"ill be honest this is an amazing app thank you"
"Took between ¬£7-9 per month from my account for 4 years after I cancelled. Customer service is a stonewall. My online chat with their customer service ended when I asked for a higher up or further investigation after they offered ¬£26.97 when I'm owed over ¬£300. They did the online equivalent of hanging up on me."
"Great entertainment, affordable monthly payments, my family and i always enjoy watching new shows on nerflix..sometimes i watch cartoons with my little nephews..it's jist amazing"
"I loved the new movie that came out last month, amazing movie!"
"Joined Netflix for one reason BREAKING BAD & BETTER CALL SAUL , nothing else worth to be watched , tons of old movies and slow boring TV shows available online"
"Was good in the past, but is now a propaganda machine for the Elite, how sad, most people don't even realize the opinions they form are based on un-supported propaganda, and once they hear it 11 times or more, they tend to believe it, even though no supporting evidence is ever provided."
"The best streaming service for range of things to watch. Disney plus at ¬£5.99 is great, until you realise there isn‚Äôt much new content, and you have seen everything before. Amazon video has limited new content that‚Äôs worth watching. That means Netflix wins for me. Every month there is a new series update, or something new to get in to. They have also invested heavily to bring older series to their service. This is a great way to finally watch that show you always wanted to. A great service."
"WHY DID YOU GUY CANCEL GIRL MEET MY WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Bank account double charged, both customer service and web chat not interested in sorting the problem, customer service disgusting. not only am I cancelling Netflix I'm now cancelling my bank card. SCAM. go elsewhere."
"Zero stars!! Company doubled/tripled charged me for months under the same email account. They refused to take responsibility and wouldn‚Äôt refund. Rude customer service!!! I had to speak to 4 different people because they kept hanging up or dropping the live chat when they didn‚Äôt want to discuss the issue!"
"It's too bad I have to push a button for one-star because of my disappointment I wouldn't even give them f**king one star. We can put a man on the moon with a fraction of an inch of a designated landing spot but Netflix can't figure out how to show me movies only in the language that I understand. For example English what f**king bu*ls*it is that absolutely ridiculous they want to show you that they got all these f**king titles and half of them aren't even in the language that you understand what complete and other b*llshit for $16 a month what a rip off"
"To be fair some of this was a great experience for me. I liked the variety, and kept with it for two years. I have now closed my account. I found I couldn't limit the information from them to find new ""suitable to my taste"" programmes.I do not like horror, nor am interested in Kids programmes. Drama and thrillers are great, but there seemed no way through to a tickbox to remove unwanted suggestions. The suggested and tried (5 minutes) reappeared even after thumbs down. Watched programs came back as recommendations (Not helpful). Loved Bloodline, Intelligence, Secret City Star Trek Discovery, and the Crown. would come back but Netflix need to find a way to ""Declutter"". Also subtitles and foreign language films need a tickbox. I am hard of hearing, and cannot watch foreign programmes."
"Received email today saying Netflix have cancelled my account due to disputed charges. First I've heard of it - been a customer for several years. Contact Netflix to find out what's going on - they say my bank has disputed the charges and so not paid them. That is the only solution - Netflix couldn't possibly have made an error. I contact the bank who I've been a customer with for 20+ yrs - they say they can't dispute the payment without my say so and confirm they have no record of me ever contacting them to dispute the payment. Netflix = don't know what they're doing."
"Company double billed me hundreds of pounds and and refused to return the charges. Service advisor was rude and sarcastic saying and refused to help saying there was nothing he could do, yet his supervisor managed to be a little helpful, so a liar as well."
"Please remove all subtitles if I want to read a book I will buy one thanks"
"If you have any problems, their customer service is the worst. instead of trying to help you, by thoroughly understanding the issue, they will give you different links to read. Try this. Then this. Then this.There is no accountability if it is the app that has an issue. They will blame the network, the TV or the internet speed. They will not consider this as an issue in their app and do not address this as something they need to improve. They are never wrong"
"I was,watching the Bates Motel season one episode one. The content warning notes smoking and bad language... there was a violent rape scene in this episode that was very upsetting... I would not have watched it if I'd known... VERY upsetting and violent... please pay more attention to program content..."
"I have a Chromebook and Netflix has stopped working on it, since the update a few days ago."
"Read the rest of these reviews people and take them seriously.... Netflix is a shady scammy service and I will probably never use it again. A fraud pool.  Be careful putting any card info in their system and be sure to use a card that you do not use often with a low balance because this is a scammy service. I could never change my email and then discovered I couldn't change my password either... all this after they suddenly automatically upgraded my service after only two weeks and without my knowledge. I discovered that while trying to change the password that I could never change.... why was I upgraded when it is only me I don't need any extra devices on my account and also why couldn't I change my log in credentials... probably because all the scam artists working there let friends and family use your netflix account!!  And forget customer service.... what customer service??  Terrible service. Switch to HULU and Amazon Prime and pay the same or a little more and get more recent movies and new shows instead of watching every single movie created in the 90's while the rest of the world is watching all of the recent stuff on other sites like HULU"
"An amazing range and selection of films with good quality. Highly recommend it!"
"Excellent! A great range of films"
"10% of dramas are very good.10% are ok, 10% are ok if you have nothing better to do, the rest is rubbish.When something good, can be spoilt by stupid text on screen explaining the sounds you can hear, and some you can't.All in all, very poor"
"It used to be better, the kids content however are they still enjoying big time so we keep the service for them"
"I had to contact customer services in order to log in, this was sorted out successfully, however, on checking my bank statement, they had doubled my subscription. I live alone, I can only view content on one device only, so be aware!!"
"Historically service was excellent.Recently it is none existent. They refer you to stock remedies, none of which resolve the problem and if you are unfortunate to be using the chat line then eventually they will disconnect you without warning and you either restart or give up.They always blame the TV manufacturer, the ISP, the set top box provider or you, the customer for not rebooting your equipment regularly.They never accept the blame."
"I don‚Äôt know why most of the movies or series are not in English or there‚Äôs bery tittle English yet they say what we are able to view is based on location. My account is opened in GB and that‚Äôs where I watch from but I‚Äôm getting mad already, can‚Äôt keep reading subtitles. What exactly I‚Äôm I paying for? Will obviously cancel subscription"
"Shows are not as great as before, storyline are no longer exiciting"
"Netflix is doing fraud  transactions  twice  in week from icici bank.Without my permission they debited 499/-From icici bank savings accounts. Again next day they were trying to debited 199/-.but before this transaction I had blocked my icici account due to Netflix doing fraud transactions. I request you all viewers don't use Netflix. They are doing fraud transactions."
"My kids love Netflix Very reasonable priced"
"Worth it for the money - a reasonable selection of movies and TV, reasonable price, works really well on my phone, tablet and laptop. Had a couple of glitches in the past but these have always been ironed out quickly!"
"Very poor level of customer service. Got double-billed due to a fault at the netflix side and customer service stated could do nothing and to contact my bank despite the issue being with the same email address."
"I love it and in the seven deadly sins please make a part 2"
"For the price it is great value. (Got the basic one device only at around 6 quid)Not as extensive a selection as I thought but does what is says on the tin and plays the films or whatever you choose without one single ad, not even one for Netflix itself."
"Terrible security - someone keeps hacking my account and changing the subscription settings.  Netflix customer service is polite but useless.   No refund was offered.  AVOID.  I had a much better experience with Hulu."
"Clicked on a free Trials link for Netflix it took me to a sign up page where it never said once that the 1 month free trial was not available in the UK it should have said clearly that I would be charged from the minute I signed up not some misleading rubbish"
"So many errors, lately. Nsez-403 my favorite one, basically you can't watch. Avoid netflix!"
"Online Perfect for whatc movies, series and more cont"
"i have been with netflix for a couple of years now ,at irst it was quite good ,but it gets boring and frustrating very quickly ,the programmes apart from a few are very mediocre and there are far too many foriegn language films with crappy subtitles its as if netflix is taking people for fools and doling out cheap foriegn crap ,i watched a movie the other day called birdcatcher about a girl from a jewish family hiding in plain sight from jew hating ss soldiers she was masquerading as a boy  ,it was so obvious she was a girl it was laughable but the eagle eyed germans didnt bat an eyelid ,it was ridiculous tripe i had to turn off ,thats the problem they put on badly percieved shows not in english ,they keep very old shows for years without changing ,far too many zombie monster rubbish all badly made and increase prices yearly ,its getting to the stage now where i am forlornly flicking through every genre and failing to find a show that appeals to me ,or attempting to watch something and turnng it off as it fails to inspire my attention ,"
"More interested in Netflix originals than films on here. Some excellent Netflix originals TV shows. For the price can't really complain."
"The idea is amazing to be able to watch ‚Äòany‚Äô movie or tv series at home but in my experience the word ‚Äòany‚Äô to Netflix means limited to old tv series from 90‚Äôs and early 00‚Äôs only and the movies are usually low budget ones that bore you within minutes."
"So due to the halt of all of the television production since covid 19 I decided to sign up for Netflix and didn't receive the free 30 day trial they've always offered! I then found out that they canceled the free 30 day trial and was very disgusted with them that they did so when this pandemic began so obviously trying to capitalize on it and gouge people! #netflix #whatashallowmove"
"Good when you're first signed up but after a few months everything you wanted to watch has been watched and new stuff comes out real slow. The app is awful, watching through a browser like google is much, much better. You can see thumbnails while forwarding or rewinding. The scroll bars stay active while cursor is on them and don't disappear every 3 seconds which is frustrating."
"I called because they suspended my account, my payment is through tmobile. When I go to both my tmobile and Netflix accounts its says payments by tmobile. Customer service says there's nothing they can do about it. I'm not making going to make payments to them so they can double dip."
"Good Value, No buffering and excellent choice of programmes."
"Been a customer for a few years now. interesting content, good collection of tv shows."
"I am really sad that Netflix cancelled one day at a time so now I can‚Äôt watch season four ."
"Netflix suspended my account for not paying $15.00 after 10 days past due. I have been loyal customer for past 5 years on auto pay. Lost my job due to Coronavirus stay home. Just got new job and they could not wait 15 days!!üò°üò°Thank you Netflix for looking out for your customers in this pandemic. You lost a customer for life!!!!!!"
"Why don‚Äôt you guys have IT2 on Netflix ? Was really disappointed."
"One of the worst platformsOk so for a while i got netflix, ok so first off, the damn thing doesnt offer higher quality in single monitor viewing(packages) which doesnt give much flexibility in how the user views content, second, when you watch a movie, the damn thing doesnt remember where you left off most of the time so you just end up guessing(both movies and series), then thirdly who on earth decided NOT to put in a god damn auto skip intro feature, its the most annoying thing ever  theres no wonder people still illegally download, OK and finally, you end up seeing say ""Home Alone"" but then realising the rest are not on netflix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Total garbage ill stick to my 50p dvd store so i can watch them multiple times!"
"i got a text supposedly from Netflix saying due to the Corona virus they were giving 3 free months out, so i called Netflix and told them this and they said yes its real. i gave them my info and 3 weeks later im charged for 2 months of premium. ANOTHER set of internet thieves.....never again will i use Netflix."
"Clearly the worse customer service ever... there is none ! My account was hijacked because of their terrible security (we didn't share our account) when we chatted they were unable to fix it !!!! Now I have to call my bank and make a stop payment because they can't even locate my credit in their systems yet they are billing me !!! Worse company ever"
"I had very bad experience from netflix customer support respondWorst respond ever.I had conversations with Lida maria (customer service)Looks like the customer service doesn‚Äôt have experience at all to give the right respond to client.She couldn‚Äôt give any good conversation when she couldn‚Äôt give any solutions. She even deleted the ticket Review immediately so i don‚Äôt have any chance to write my comment and review her respond"
"Why is it still so expensive when Amazon and Disney+ give the same or more content for less, and let you use it on at least 5 devices but Netflix make you pay extra to see it on more than one screen...No longer good value, will go bust if it stays like this."
"It would honestly be better if they stopped taking the good films/tv shows down from there every 5 minutes."
"Need to be honest and tell you when things are dubbed or even better allow you to exclude them. Also should be allowed to say not interested in things so can block so many repeat adverts like Crappy tiger program, so annoying to repeatly shown the same adverts when your not interested."
"Expensive subscription. The platform used to be better than that .. right now it is not worth the money."
"Netflix is available whenever I have the time ie. on my own schedule and for a reasonable cost a month. I have spend $10 a month in worse ways. Netflix has a vast variety of shows no matter what I feel like watching-comedies, westerns, dramas, whatever. I like that I can binge watch shows that I didn't see when they on prime time and now I can go back and watch them now. For example I just discovered FRIENDS"
"An excellent app....the best app for surfing films online,...I so much love this app!!"
"Do they ever actually put new movies/tv shows on? Every week you pay for the same badly made, poor quality movies and tv shows. Their foreign films/shows are poorly dubbed with voices that put you off watching. They have six versions of the same type of show. Witchcraft and failed crime shows are about the only thing on offer. While there have been a few exceptions, most of the offerings you can get on free to air. Remind me what I am paying for? Lousy and too expensive!"
"Too many foreign films. Can't stand the dubbing."
"It takes a while for videos to load when watching from our Playstation, why is this?"
"Movies do not load and you get error- code: nw-1-1000., even though you are connected to the internet. You call tech support and they cannot fix the issue. The movie thunb pics do not even load, so you can not even choose a movie to watch. Other times, the movie loads to 25% and that's it."
"Very expensive and why you don‚Äôt show my favorite shows any more?"
"Netflix are the biggest ripoff we have ever had the misfortune of using they duplicated our account tuck double payments out of our account for the same standard package and refused to give use the overpayments back never use direct debit or give them your bank details they will rip you off buy a top up card from a shop instead adleast you keep control of your money üò°ü§¨"
"I couldn't have the free trial just because the person who I bought  my device from used to have Netflix before (this is not mentioned at all in their policy-even if it was it's discrimination). Support (Martin) is arrogant and a real douchebag. I  will return to HBO. There the supports are nice and helpful, lots of good movies  and cheaper as well."
"I pay Netflix every month and I have absolutely no use for it... I put in a movie request months ago and I heard nothing from them not have I seen it posted I chatted with them online and the tell me they have to get approval for it I said ok so the two movies I chose are old and must be very special cause you have all the other movies so I will be searching for a new movie source"
"genius, brilliant."
"In my opinion, too much in-house production with - well - mixed quality. Recently I was annoyed by the way changes in the terms and conditions are pushed through - just before you start watching a film. I have cancelled the account."
"Yes, some shows there are great but actually after you watch them you dont have nothing to do. Too low films quantity. I want subscription with 90% of imdb list for that price"
"genius, brilliant."
"i joined netflix around 2 years ago monthly charge is reasonable but i have a question where do you get your films apart from the odd one or to which are good most are from late 70s early 80s or the rest are absolute rubbish most have no story lines full of absolute nonsense and either about ghosts demons and evil i have yet to see a box office film yet really am thinking about cancelling my membership Allen"
"customer service is as good as crap (I'm not allowed to use the S word, which would have been more appropriate for this level of atrocity). I'm not able to download any titles at all and they keep flip-flopping on their answers, ranging from wifi issues to phone issues to ios issues. Obvious that they're pulling answers out of their asses. if not for the fact that I'm sharing an account with someone and I'm paying a minimal amount, I'd have cancelled this bleeping account long ago."
"Content wise, any day Netflix is better. I would recommend!"
"It's Netflix. It's great!"
"Hopeless trying to log in. I‚Äôve changed my e mail address which has been acknowledged on one device, but I am unable to log in on another device as my new address isn‚Äôt recognised. My CORRECT password is also being declined. Even when going to the page that asks for name of account and card number associated with account, it doesn‚Äôt even recognise that and I‚Äôve been paying ¬£10.99 and ¬£12.99 off the named card for 2 years. Why do these companies have such awful software??Gary Chapman."
"I have been with netflix since they were introduced into Canada..  since then there rates have more than doubled .. and during this time when we cannot leave our homes you think they would throw out some type of kind gesture to all their faithful clients.. like a free month ,  With all the streaming services out there .... and for half the price like Hulu, Prime, Disney etc   yep it is time to cut the ties"
"Absolute scum suckers! So Europe-wide they DOWNGRADE everyone's service to cope with the extra demand... NOT MY PROBLEM NETFLIX! Give people what they are paying for; HD 2 Screens for ¬£11.99 month! NOT 'STANDARD DEFINITION'  2 screens! Using MY subscription to subsidise more subscribers... FILTHY GREEDY SCUM SUCKERS! Profit profit profit!!! Greed, pure greed!"
"They charged our visa double for 3 months and they claimed that we opened a second account. I explained to them that we did not. But they insist on the charges no matter what.other companies offering free services like Fido long distance to help people during the corona virus time.  While Net Flex is refusing to give refund for a mistake they did."
"Looks like they are struggling for new stuffüôà now they seem to be taking foreign movies and putting very bad English talkover VERY POOR Netflix at least make it sound better üëé."
"Joined 2 years ago thought it was sh*te no decent programmes & films  joined again See if it got better nope still sh*te  its Rip off... money for old rope... nothing worth watching..time to stop the payments.."
"DUMB CUSTOMER SERVICE. BAD REALLY BAD. NO COMMON. SENSE, NO THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX."
"Being passed onto a paysite to resolve problems whether it is refundable or not is unacceptable. xx"
"I used Netflix for years and I do enjoy the shows on it and how frequently they update their selection. However, my account got messed up, and I spent 30+ minutes on their live chat only to get NO results. We went through step and step and they still couldn't just unlock the account and let me watch my shows."
"Netflix is a great streamer to watch movies and shows that already existed before, most of netflix original series however are trash. I watch shows to relax and ease my mind. However I haven't seen one netflix original show that is not political and tries to push you some sort of fuckedup opinion on matters on you. Watching it makes me so frustrated and nervous. I'll just stick with the old shows... which are by the way hard to find on netflix..."
"Digusting programs . Clearly  Netflix  gets turned on by constantly  authorising  and producing  fouls disgusting  programs  depicting  violent rape. On NO LEVEL IS IT EVER APPROPRIATE TO DEPICT  RAPE AS PART OF AN ENTERTAINMENT PACKAGE. I will therefore be terminating my subscription and will go back to Google play. And yes, I am writing this as a male, thanks for ruining my evening Shitflix"
"Neflix keeps freezing over and over. But if I switch over to my VPN same country then I get blocked by Netflix. First that was what worked but now Neflix decided same country and area is not ok...but it solved my problem so I could pay what I ACTUALLY PAID for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now 100% useless!!!!Support keeps repeating uuugh we do not allow vpns = we dont allow you to watch our content even though you have paid for it!!!!!!!HATE!! Lockdown in Vietnam and this!!!"
"Netflix might be a little expensive but at the end of the day its worth it for the amount of entertainment they provide."
"1/5 for customer service chat team. Advised there is no legal department to contact regarding a refund they admit to owing me?! Surely this is not legal!"
"PAOLO was great, he helped me in the live chat since phone calling is not an option right now. My account was hacked and he was able to help me get it back within minutes. Really appreciated him."
"Great work Netflix!The content, the interaction with the app, the availability of the service, the ease of use. All just a complete work of highly talented company!"
"Should be a 0 review, I've just contacted Netflix customer service online chat, to ask for help with days of getting a dark picture, I asked for a refund, their answer? If I give you a refund, I have to close your account immediately!  Absolutely disgusting, why would I want that? I'm entitled to ask for a refund if I'm receiving poor service.  Not according to ALEXANDROS IT ISN'T!!!!   Substandard service coupled with incompetent and unhelpful staff."
"Never any of the films you search for and for one good ish film there 40 crap films disappoints 99% of the time ."
"I am absolutely disugusted at the poor program services Netflix provides . I cannot belive that Netflix took some of the best shows off nd I‚Äôm annoyed ab it"
"always something to see on Netflix and it is really cheap"
"I am paying for another account I am sharing with my mother in FULL. I have found unknown charges on my bank statement from NETFLIX. I Identified an account with an email address that does not belong to me and I contacted support asking for a refund. They refunded 3 out of 4 charges refusing the refund for the 4th one as I did not contact them sooner. I initially spoke with R. and she said she will send my a form to request a refund for the 4th charge as it is my fault i did not see the charges earlier. I actually was naive enough to believe this. No form received. Today, I contact support again. I realized she never requested my actual email so that she could have sent me the form to begin with. I reach to K. Never asked me my name or anything which is basic customer support, to ask to whom you are speaking with. I have 7 years of customer support behind me so this is always the first thing you do. Hello, to whom I am speaking with... Regardless to say in the middle of the conversation he addressed me ""SIR"". All the answers I got is that if I want to complain I need to call them. I am quarantined and I do not have a phone available. His answer- go find a phone. How can a customer support agent lack empathy at this level? I explained again and again the whole situation and he kept telling me he will not accept my accusations of being rude and disrespectful. They refused my right to speak with a supervisor or a manager, they refused to refund all my charges so I am still short of 15 euros for the account of whomever while I am paying in full, each month, another account. They refused to let me know how to officially make a complaint and my bank refused to refund me the charge as I need to contact them. REALLY DISAPPOINTED."
"I love Netflix because of its great variety of the newest movies and tv series. If you are under quarantine it's something that will totally entertain you!"
"Not get any famous and new films in Netflix, Amazon is better than this for films and cheaper than Netflix."
"I started using on covid 19 lock down and I've got to say it rubbish all their films are 1.0 bad acting bad directors original netflix shows 3.9 same they look like they was filmed in 80s"
"have been a long standing customer of Amazon but after recommendations from friends i ¬†decided to open an account with Netflix. I have a cinema room and a theatre system in my house. I use Apple TV box receiver to view all my contents including Amazon prime and have no problem in getting sound for the contents via the theatre sound system. Unfortunately with the Netflix app on Apple TV this is not possible as your app is either encrypted or has no technology to permit sound of the contents via a home theatre sound system. This means that every time I want to watch Netflix programs I can only use the speakers on my television which limits the experience and enjoyment.¬†Fortunately this is not the case for other ¬†apps that on the Apple TV device likes of Amazon, You tube VEVO and many others as they all seem work properly with the home theatre sound system and it seems this problem is unique to only Netflix which is a pity.If I knew that this problem existed I would probably have not subscribed to Netflix hence as to why I want to cancel my subscription.If Amazon can get better contents like Netflix I probably wouldn‚Äôt have subscribed to Netflix as Netflix has more content for Bollywood material. So sad Netflix can‚Äôt help in fixing a simple problem."
"They have a good range of shows but they will cut the streaming quality wherever possible to save money - even before Covid-19 - and they won't tell you. With the Covid-19 cut in quality the picture you get is terrible, and there is no talk of compensation for those who pay for a higher quality stream. They say it's to 'help' internet service providers keep up with the new high demand. Quite frankly, I call bull."
"Netflix is only worried about registering as many accounts as possible even if it means poor customer experiences. They refused to help me fix error codes on the app and blamed Amazon."
"This is an honest to goodness conversation with Netflix! Make up your own mind.You are now chatting with: JosephNetflix JosephHi. Thanks for contacting Netflix. Can I get your name and email to ensure I'm looking at the correct account?You I am unable to pay for Netflix this is the third day in a row. I have one mastercard, two visa cards and an Amex none of them work. Your email checklist regarding payments has not helped I have gone through all the options. Yes I have plenty of credit, no my cards are not blocked all four of my banks have confirmed it and yes my all my banks state that they list a temporary hold on the account but Netflix does not follow through with transaction. Unless Netflix thinks four different banks and three payment networks are down, this is a Netflix issue not a bank one. I have also tried calling but your lines are down due to Covid 19.RedactedNetflix JosephI'm looking...Youok thank youNetflix JosephIn customer service, we can't always see the details of why a card didn't work. We also can't make them go through. In this case, I can see that the cards aren't working. The options are to try a different method of payment or use a gift card. Can you tell me what country you're currently in?Youunited kingdomYouthose options clearly are not going to workYouafter four cards that is pointless if you can't see what is going on please contact someone who can and then get back to me by emailNetflix JosephThere is no one at Netflix who can make the cards go through. If they don't work on their own when they're tried and the financial institutions can't make it happen either, there's nothing further that can be done. Do you know what country the account was created in?YouI believe it was Turkey I was on holiday at the time. In addition of Netflix can't fix their payment processing you can hardly expect me to.Youwith nothing further to be done all I can do is stop being a customer and leave a bad review.Netflix JosephI'm asking these questions to find a solution. And we have one. If you cancel the account, it will close. And then you can purchase a gift card in the UK to restart it. You must cancel first because of the currency that it's trying to charge in. A UK gift card won't work on it while it's open. But you will be able to cancel and restart with the gift card.YouI have no intention of purchasing gift cards it is waste of time and given the lockdown in the Uk pointless.YouI will however cease to be a customer of Netflix and will leave a bad review.Netflix JosephYou can buy them online. I can send you an email with a link that can suggest places to buy them.YouI do not wish to purchase gift cardsNetflix JosephOkay. Do you have any other questions about this, then?Youno unless you have something helpful to process my payment.Netflix JosephThe one thing which is impossible is making the cards go through.Netflix JosephAnything else?YouI just asked you, if you can do nothing else just say soNetflix JosephI have given you the only other solution there is...gift cards.Netflix JosephAnything else?Youyou can not solved my problem you have just tried to get to buy gift cardsNetflix JosephThe only solution to the problem is a gift card.YouI think the only solution to this conversation is to leave before I lose my patience. I wish I could say thank you but you have been less than helpful goodbye.Netflix JosephHave a great day!"
"It¬¥s for money. That sums it up."
"Ex The platform, blood father, ozark and others listed as top 10 movies in the US. That kids can select"
"Wasted 20 minutes waiting for ""customer service"" understanding COVID-19. Sarcasm aside, want everyone to be safe. First priority.That being said, agent that didn't understand basic internet app ""client vs. backend settings"" told me it was the issue with my TV. It is not. It was a known issue that Netflix basically apparently ignores."
"Someone hacked my account, and changed the email address associated with my account. When I talked to someone via chat, they couldn‚Äôt verify my account using the card currently on file, but instead required the debit card I had originally opened the account with. I have updated my payment since that card was lost years ago. Rather than take responsibility for their system being easily hacked and their verification system being garbage they told me I would need to recover the full lost debit card number from my bank. They even tried to blame me for not updating my card, even though clearly I did since I‚Äôve been getting charged every month. I asked to speak to a supervisor and got the same story. Just spent 50 minutes on hold with my bank to find out they will only give that number in person. Netflix offered to cancel my account and start a new one, but I would lose all my account data for my family and be charged twice for the same month. Wasted 2.5 hours of my morning so far and still no way to reset my login. Netflix customer service is garbage."
"OOOOOOO! I love this site! The Witcher, Riverdale, Strange Things, Black Mirror ... it's just awesome! It seems to me that for this site there are not enough five stars. It costs all 10!"
"Brilliant work! Effective and prompt response!"
"Not Worth it I payed  ¬£11.99 HDR, now I can‚Äôt even get SD Quality they using Coronavirus as excuse when in fact just don‚Äôt have enough b***s to cope with service, if Coronavirus is to blame and they should refund you the difference Basically charging us for streaming service we get anyway now more streaming services are coming and much better for better price NETFLIX YOU SUCK charging customers for service you can even provide when  instead you should refund the money If in case is Coronavirus to blame NOT RECOMMEND ANY MORE THAT RIGHT NETFLIX SUCKS"
"It's not worth it and neither secure. Someone got over my account and I couldn't  contact the team as the are not working because of covid19 .... it s suck as just yesterday I've payed  for my account 12 ¬£. Really dissapointed  that someone could  change my email  and pass that easy."
"THE CUSTOMER CARE(LIVE CHAT) IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE ON THE PLANET. THEY ARE TOO RUDE AND HELPLESS. DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER SIMPLE QUESTIONS.IT IS LIKE CUSTOMERS ARE FORCED TO WATCH WHAT THEY ASK US TO WATCH. NOT A WIDE DATABASE; BETTER YOU SWITCH TO OTHER STREAMING SERVICES LIKE AMAZON OR YOUTUBE SO THAT YOU WON'T INVEST AND THEREBY WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS CRAP..!"
"Everytime we try and look for a good movie to watch Netflix doesn't have it. It's good for series, and that's about it. Amazon has way more movies then Netflix.  Netflix Canada is horrible!!!"
"Just a few days ago my Netflix account was hacked and they changed the email address and password so I couldn't log in anymore.  I called Netflix and the situation was (supposed to be) resolved. My account was restored. I changed my password and then added my cell phone number for verification.  They told me they never implemented two-step verification like other companies but that I would be ok moving forward. About an hour and a half ago, I received an email notification that my email has been changed.  My email and phone numbers are no longer associated with my account and I can't log in to change or cancel my membership.  I tried to call and because of the virus, they said their call helpline is down and the online live chat keeps kicking off with wait times flip-flopping from 15 min to 45 min to 1 hour back to 20 min and so on.  Then they kick-off and I have to redo it.How is it possible that an internet company even allows the possibility of someone getting into your account and being able to cut off the account holder so easily? MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION IS ATTACHED TO THIS ACCOUNT. This is UNACCEPTABLE.  I'm requesting my account be canceled and I'm done with Netflix until they install better security measures. I hope to hear from them soon."
"My account was probably hacked as I cant login! It says e-mail address doesnt exist! The payment is due to come out from my account and I cant get through to Customer service as they recieve high volume of calls and just hang up on you. Hmm a bit strange. Worse Customer service ever!"
"I was missing the rest of my trial, and I got it back from 1 rep, but not the 2 days it was gone. Trayvon REFUSED TO GIVE ME 2 DAYS ON A TRIAL THAT IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. He kept spouting garbage about credits and if it isn't their fault....Since he didnt read my notes about the issue, he showed his laziness. All I was asking for was 2 days. There was a strong chance I would have kept the service, but because of his inability to treat customers well, I'll look elsewhere. That rep was useless, and if the company encourages the reps not to credit small amount of time, they will lose more potential customers. They lost me."
"They lowered the quality because the EU told them to, but did not tell us the customers and still charged us full price for this. I'm not going to use Netflix ever again. All Netflix content exist as torrents I found out which is free."
"My account has been hacked into. My e-mail was changed so I cannot log in any more. Live Chat or by phone nothing. you cant event be in a wait list, it just says the lines are busy call later. Probably the worst customer service I have ever had."
"I signed up to Netflix on 15/03/2020, got billed on 16/03/2020 and as of the same day, I am now unable to sign in to my account. Even though I signed up and watched it on the first day AND I've been charged already, Netflix does not let me sign in to my account. I cannot get through to customer service on the phone and the online help centre is USELESS. It says I have incomplete billing details but yeat i have an email with my account setup and the money has come out of my account already, however you won't let me use what I'm paying for?! ABSOLUTE JOKE."
"Been with Netflix many years but not anymore..... terrible customer service..my account had been deactivated possibly due to being inactive for a while,so what!I'm paying for it so who gives them the right to deactivate my account yet still charge my monthly payment... maybe a friendly email letting me know.Now trying to get through to their customer service is ridiculous,has to be via your account online but problems with that to reset password,takes you through the process of setting up a second account. What! So they can charge you again I don't think so. So I go online and have to wait  over 20 minutes for a response , this person now has problems understanding my English ,I was born in England and can speak the queen's language rather well..but she gets me to spell out each letter of my email...using the phonetic alphabet, now I'm just angry and request to cancel  my subscription .She informs me I need to give my details over the phone regarding my bank card number lol....i just request they send confirmation of cancellation by email but no,they don't do that .I need to check with my bank the following month that no payment has been taken...I'm lost for words...."
"Netflix dvd use to be great ,,,, absolutely disappointing now .... terrible service."
"I am a great believer of everything happens for a reason. Netflix has been unable to give me the real satisfactory response or explanation to why this is happening or has happened. I have my own personal understanding of what is going on. The reality is that I have no trust in the the handling privacy of accounts and card details information on certain sites."
"Arrogant, condescending customer service. They've actually accused me of lying, I couldn't believe it. What actually happened is that they were trying to rip me off, and after that they thought it would be a good idea to lecture me instead of apologising. Avoid them."
"I can't believe that in the 21st Century the Netflix service department that barely speaks english can't figure out how to repair access to a hacked account. They are incompetent nit wits and should be arrested for impersonating an entertainment company.  I cancelled my subscription and wouldn't use Netflix if it was last option on the planet. Netflix, you suck!"
"netflix have been charging me twice a month for a while instead of once....they dont answer my emails and calls go on to automatic...ive looked online and this is happening to alot of people,,,and apparantly they dont refund anyone"
"I love watching movies on Netflix , kinda part of my life now"
"It really need some updates. Most of the TV shows are 2-3 even 5 seasons ahead. So you start watch something and you can not finish it. Really annoying."
"It's OK....... But the price keeps going up, to be honest I wanted to cancel but my partner who is not technical is used to the App so I've kept it for now.But as soon as the price goes up again I'm out and we wont miss it.Why I want to leave: Old content, content is based on region, limited selection, Netflix originals released on TV first. And PRICE."
"Not impressed i have had my acvount for 4 years as tbey used to have good content but they seem to remove all the good tv shows thinking a might just cancel my subsxription shocking"
"Good content but bad customer service. My account got suspended once for no reason and I had to make a new one."
"Does not help people who did not registered their email on their service and I asking to remove it. I try to LiveChat them and they just end the chat. I keep getting reset password when I never registered for their service."
"I wouldn‚Äôt ever get Netflix again. Someone hacked my account and changed my email changing the charges to my account. I was being billed wayyy more than I signed up for. The customer service is horrible help."
"I would give minus stars if it was an option. I signed up to Netflix and within 1 week the account had been hacked. The account email and password were changed and I can no longer access the account. Netflix told me they can close the account but their policy is to keep accounts dormant should customers wish to reactivate their account. Whilst keeping my bank account details. Subsequently the hacker keeps activating the account and another Netflix charge appears on my account . Netflix will do nothing to help. I have had to contact my bank to block Netflix payments."
"I was deducted for 300+ czk yesterday on my account without clicking any netflix now,. its been months... But surprisingly for being out whole day yesterday i just paid netflix? How is that right? I don't use netflix anymore but i just paid without my authorization? Is that how netflix works? Because i don't remember having a chance clicking my phone and search for Netflix yesterday not even today until i saw my debit transaction?!!! Is this a joke? Because i don't see it in a way you're seeing it. I didn't expect i would be shock more than the available movies you have. If i was aware of this i should have watch Netflix all day,... But not!!! And this isn't funny. Now I'm pi.... off! You're not being helpful."
"You know as much as they charge for Netflix, there is nothing on this channel. There's a bunch of stupid shows that make no sense whatsoever and I wouldn't recommend Netflix to my worst enemy and I plan on canceling it and never getting it again because it's a waste of hard-earned money. What a joke!!!"
"Amidst great series, such as ""traitors"" and a few more, the historical series are absolute bottom. Sporadic re-enactments are interrupted with huge frequency by idiotic Anglo-Saxon historians telling you in a moronic, condescending way what to think of the pictures with their own comments you have just seen. The intellectual level equals ""The Sun"". Why can we not hear some German historians? The only serious research in WW2 in the last 30 years, into subjects such as the German resistance, has been carried out almost exclusively bu German historians. Same applies to ""Roman Empire"". Awful, biased, superficial"
"how can it be possible to have so bad UX/UI?I am really trying to understand it but cant."
"I am absolutely outraged... Been trying to get onto Netflix for more than 3 hours, called their helpline.. miraculously get in while on the phone, then get fobbed off: ""you are online now and there is no problem, what do you want me to say""... OMG!!!!"
"I get tired of netflix. Thank god I now trade and I go short on it all the time"
"Beware !! Not safe I had my account hacked and could not use . Netflix no help at all i paid for others to watch ."
"The films are not very good! They seem to get the license for all the substandard once! They could at least put the old iconic films on with great talented actors! Hopefully something will come up soon to replace Netflix and do better, as there are a lot of really good films worth watching!"
"I have been a Netflix customer for many years, however, I am going to stop the disc option because the turnaround is extremely slow. When I call they blame the postal service. The first few years were great."
"Customer service worse than useless... Shocking actually for such a huge company with so many customers. They need UK customer service agents and ones who understand simple questions."
"Pretty clever of Netflix to release ""Outbreak"" during coronavirus. Sure to boost subscriptions and heighten fears"
"I've been at my familys house the netflix acount thay use on the Virginin only let's me wach one or two films the rest keeps coming up problem with title then I checked out network connection that's all fine acout is up to date yet most of the films won't play what's the point of paying for it when we can't wach most of the films on it im not happy with netflix it's a wast of time and money"
"Generally a good range of films to watch and very enjoyable. Worth the subscription"
"Bojack Horseman I must say is written well for an adult cartoon. For some of the topics it hits and things that couldn't be seen in a real life series. I just binge watch all 6 seasons in less than a week. I see myself in Bojack at times and also in other people I know that are dealing with drinking issues and drugs. You also still have time to but some good silly funny things in it that could only happen in a cartoon. I think its a great show and if people take the time to watch they them selfs may find something or a character to relate too. Thank you for the series and can't wait for the next season. Keep up the great work.Edmund Grzywinski"
"Netflix years ago was fantastic in terms of client service -always helpful, chatty, and fast action.  Now in truth very little need for contact as it generally 'does what it says on the box'But:  On hols in Portugal and just finished chatting with 'in my opinion' a badly trained and ill informed operative who could not explain my inability to stream the content of my home country.  Obfuscation to cloud a lack of knowledge - In times gone by the people there made the call and sorted - not anymore !"
"APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE. Period."
"Netflix sent me email (Netflix - 30 days free). Then they charged my card ¬£11.99 the same day. I've never tried Netflix before and their customer service said they have no much options for me.Yes I got a refund but bad experience."
"The application is awesome but the customer support is really pathetic. I called to them regarding one of the series related issue and there is Sana qureshi named executive who spoke very rudely. This lady is a perfect example of worst customer service. I never argued but she was rude for no reason and just disconnected the call. Please take some actions."
"Netflix itself is good but it's customer service is horrible...or i was unlucky enough to get the most arrogant and sour person on the other end of live chat. She managed to turn my enquiry from a basic question to questioning whether i want to keep my account all together. Really poor customer service"
"Works very well mostly, personally believe it to be the best service amongst it's competitors."
"So this story starts with me having to cancel my current debit card where all my payments are associated.Simply i had to update the card in all my services (spotify, tolls, ect), but apparently Netflix has some sort of a problem, I tryed all my 5 cards (including credit card), and several virtual cards... still nothing.SO they apparently don't want my money, but i want their content."
"I will be deactivating my account for 4 months. Netflix needs to swap out about 20 movies with new ones.. I've been seeing the same thing for 3 months now."
"Unbelievable, I was downloading a couple of seasons of Better Call Saul. One of the episodes did not complete. Looked like it completely downloaded but would not give me a check mark. I deleted and restarted the download. At which pint I received an error message saying I have reach yearly download limit for that episode. I called NETFLIX support who said they couldn‚Äôt help it was intended behavior. I asked to talk to a supervisor. Who also insisted it was intended behavior. I explained again application ran into a problem. Why should I be penalized for NETFLIX‚Äôs error. They couldn‚Äôt help. Now I have two seasons with one episode missing. What a bummer. Fix your damn app NETFLIX."
"Getting dvds in the mail has slowed down dramatically over the past 6 months or so.The turnaround for getting another dvd sent after returning the previous one back used to be only two days. The turnaround now is about 5 days. It was upsetting enough when the movie selection started getting worse over the past year. The movies you could stream became mail order only and new movies that come out netflix does not have but redbox does. Time to cancel Netflix soon if things get worse. Sad because ive been a customer for many many years."
"Great shows what is there to complain about"
"In Romania they say on the first page that you can ""try it now"" but they charge you for that. Be aware of this scam! Also the customer service is so low, they basically use the same phrases, the automatic responses. Big scam that should be avoided."
"Excellent Service , customer service is always helpfull.Thanks."
"I've been a Netflix disc subscriber for 10 years now (they have a much better movie selection on disc than streaming).  I used to have a 2-3 day turnaround from the time I sent a movie back until the next one arrived.  Since January that process has been taking at least twice as long.  I finally noticed the address on the return envelope now says Santa Ana, CA when it used to say Denver, CO (I live in Denver).  When I called Netflix support I was told the Denver facility closed in January.  I can't find a list of their shipping facilities online so I can't verify this.  I've seen other reviews online that this is happening to people around the country.  If this continues I'll just cancel my subscription and start using Redbox.Update: I've cancelled my Netflix subscription."
"My fiance and I was watching the Fuller House series on Netflix. Episode 12 and 13 in season 3 is backwards. An episode 12 Steve is proposing to his girlfriend at a New year's party, in episode 13 Steve is telling his friend DJ that he is planning to propose to his girlfriend CJ. This is very upsetting because I like Fuller house, this slip-up really threw us off."
"They somehow manage to get to you thru your cable company, they are not part of it. They sneak in a monthly payment and if  you are  not checking you your Bill often they'll keep getting your money even if you do not  use it or don't need it. Ah and don't call customer service unless you are ready to fight, because they are rude as fu..k"
"In an advertisement I was proposed to try Netflix for free for 1 month and I thought 'why not?'. Of course the trial was for ¬£11.99 as you don't really care about the price of a free trial. Then I find out that I was charged. The absolutely useless Netflix assistant lets me know that Netflix doesn't have a free trial in the UK and not being sorry or helpful at all. Not at any point when I was giving my details for the free trial subscription Netflix has let me know that I'll be charged. Netflix, are you that unsmart to scam me for ¬£11.99 and never after to have me as your customer? Such a disappointment of a company."
"They are rogue organisation. They tried with dishonest attempt to raise money for subscription by lying for 30 days free watch. They wasted my time to sign up and took my money straight away. Help centre is not helpful. I had ot cancel and i now have to wait 30 days for money that i did not want to pay. AVOID!"
"DECEPTIVE MARKETING! NO 30 DAY FREE TRIAL IN CANADA! I WAS IMMEDIATELY CHARGED FOR A MONTH OF SERVICE. I contacted customer service immediately ( 1 minute )  and they said there was nothing they could do except to cancel my subscription and I will have to pay the 1st month as the charge was posted to my Visa and non refundable. ENTRAPMENT TACTICS! I canceled and I will not re subscribe based on poor and misleading buisness practices. SCREW YOU NETFLIX"
"Website has little information and I find I can‚Äôt use it, but took the ¬£8.99 very fast so I had to cancel and lose my money."
"I was referred to netflix by a popular uk site offering 30 day trial - when I was redirected to netflix website it said enter email address and Try now. After entering details netflix charged my bank account. Its a big scam - stay away from this company - misleading adverts - Offers are still available on website and netflix is not interested to refund full amount - Use Join now instead of Try now and stop loosing customers due to cheap marketing tactics"
"The best movies & TV shows in one place, thank you for the service"
"I thought I had signed up for a free trial but apparently not, not sure how I missed that it wasnt actually a free trial, it was a free upgrade to HD  for 30 days . 9 days in my account was hacked and taken over, I had to convince Netflix it was my account to get control back. Not sure how secure there service is. Anyway I have now CANCELLED  I wont be back."
"I've only been using Netflix for a few months, and I've had no issues with the service, the content keeps me entertained and there always seems to be something to watch. However, I'm rating a one star as last night there was an issue with my account which led to it being hacked and taken over. I feel their security system and fraud prevention measures need some serious upgrades. I received two emails at 01:51am to say my account had been accessed in Brazil and Columbia and I should change my password if this wasn't me, I was in work in the UK, it definitely wasn't me. So I tried to log in immediately from the app on my phone, only to find my log in details were no longer recognised. I tried to recover password thinking maybe my phone had the wrong password stored (no idea how that would happen), there's no account registered under my email or telephone number. A quick Google of this issue shows other users have faced this problem and their account has been hacked and taken over. So I looked at contacting Netflix. The only option is to call them, a wait time of 26+ minutes... I finally get through to a very helpful and patient advisor (can't fault her) who finds my account, confirms yes it has been hacked (although doesn't seem surprised, almost like she deals with this type of call regularly), my login email has been changed, phone number has been removed. The only way she is able to save my account is she requires the last eight digits of the payment card. Now I'm in work on a nightshift, no shops are open so I never take my cards with me to work on nights, there's no other way to verify my identity. I could wait until I finish work in 8 hours time, but then the the hackers will have had my account for 8 hours and I also face the frustrating wait time to get through to someone to go through the process again. The only other option, terminate my account there and then. I was then given a code, effectively a gift card, of my remaining balance for the month, not offered a refund, so automatically presuming I'll sign up again.While it is an inconvenience having to set up the account and find all my programs again, it's not a major issue, but I don't see why Netflix doesn't have something in place like a lot of other providers, that where the main email address of the account holder is changed, the company sends the account holder an email or text alert immediately, to say your email has been changed, and if you didn't make this change, please click here and the change will be stopped. Giving you the opportunity to get in to your account to change your password or request a new password if the hacker has already changed it. It would save a lot of hassle and probably bring down the wait time on calls to get through to you. Now, you do send an email alert, a pretty pointless one, as my account was hacked at 01:51am (time I received login alerts), I received an email at 11:18am to say ""We've changed your email address, as you asked (I didn't ask, but thanks for assuming, Netflix). You will no longer be able to use your email to sign in to Netflix. If you didn't ask to change it, just contact us (via telephone!)"". Really Netflix?? 9.5 hours after the address has been changed and 9 hours after I've closed the account, you send me this email?? This should be immediate and it should be questioned with me, not told ""you will no longer be able to use your email to sign in to Netflix"".For such a huge company, you really need to up your game. Looking at other reviews and posts via Google, this isn't an isolated incident, yet you don't appear to be putting anything in place to combat it."
"The movies and shows are ok and Netflix has some decent original productions. But BOY is their customer service bad. Half the time I feel that I am talking to a bot and the other half to someone unable to understand simple sentences. I have seldom had to deal with such incompetent customer support agents. To whomever, they outsourced it - very very bad job."
"They cancelled many great shows that were popular because people didn't give good ratings or forgot to.I still like it but be careful they could make you upset when they remove or cancel your favorite show."
"This website took my money when I bought it and then said my account was deleted the next day. I don‚Äôt recommend it if you don‚Äôt want your money stolen."
"Really happy with the content that my region has - one of the best truly. But some improvements could still be done. Menu on TV is not as comfortable, as for example, on mobile or pc. Also, you could show up not only upcoming new shows or movies, but also which shows are gonna be removed and when."
"Started noticing that more and more content started appearing which was previously not available in my region. Hopefully region lock will be removed in general. Would be a great addition to services"
"Easy to use. Payments are simple to understand and manage."
"Overall great experience - site is easy to navigate especially when trying to change the package etc."
"Hey Netflix kill yourself you are rubisch"
"This app is a very fun app to use it has a lot of good movies But you may not find new movies that much it works probably and it money only in my permission i have face 1 problem before my downloads were‚Äônt working and the service was very helpful"
"I had a very worst representative. Cant even understand my real issue and vulgar. ALSO they did not give you any chance to decide whether you want to renew or what not. They charged me without my permission for this month. The first thing I experienced is I cannot access the app so I uninstalled and installed. After I checked my account they charged me without my permission.I can send a screenshot of the conversation how rude they are. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
"yet another company takes money anything goes wrong dont care and dont wanna sort anything they dont even care about customers just money"
"DON'T SIGN UP TO ANY TRIALS WITH NETFLIX - THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT REFUND!I took out the monthly trial with Netflix and they charged me before the month was up in any case. Only when I check my account I find this out. I cancel before the month is up but Customer service refuse to refund the month payment which should not have been taken. So they damage their own reputation for the sake of a few ¬£. Fools.Some of their content is also Ideological and tantamount to brainwashing. AVOID!"
"Customer service  sucks. They even lie and say there is nothing wrong with there app when I have to switch everything  off and start everything up again . And having to phone f#$King America is a pain"
"Donwnloads never work, I gave those assholez another chance and it didn‚Äôt work again so fyck  you Netflix u guys fyckng suck"
"Best service ive used for tv. Easy to set up, no buffering and great content"
"I love Netflix, great original content, even the movies are getting better."
"Very bad customer service and the don't care about there customers"
"Keep away from this US scammer! They signed me up via Virgin media when I went to check their costs via my telly. Only God knows how they did it since I never pressed any acceptance button and in any case, if I had,  UK law says there is a 'cooling off period' to enable cancellation for any contract. I have been charged ¬£11.99 for nothing even though I informed Virgin media and Netflix I didn't want it. Netflix and Virgin have NO refund policy and they bounce you back between one and the other when you attempt to resolve it!"
"Some of the content is good.Tech support is diabolical  mostly switch off and on. I knew more about technical issues.90% of the time it would buffer but stop at 20%  and therefore you could not watch anything. I had the latest firmware update on my TV but still no go so I cancelled.Updates never improve the service and each time an automatic update occured viewing usually ceased. I have Sony and Techwood TVsPoor service, poor knowledge and software upgrades frustrating."
"Great app/servis"
"STAY AWAY!!!!!! My account was hacked and someone else changed my email so I didn‚Äôt have access to my account at all. I called Netflix and they conveniently couldn‚Äôt give me the email it was changed to because in the reps words to protect the identity of the hacker. I then got transferred to a supervisor Maria who was incredibly incompetent. She didn‚Äôt understand what I was asking at all and kept telling me she needed to protect the hacker. They lied saying my PayPal info was encrypted when it isn‚Äôt so now the hackers have my PayPal info. She kept contradicting herself telling me to access the hackers profile then delete it then asked me to access it again because she forgot she told me to delete it. She couldn‚Äôt tell me if the police could get the email if they were involved. I feel violated and spit on with the way Netflix treated me."
"What`s the point in having a film like `Running with the Devil' which half way through goes in to a foreign language with NO subtitles?! I keep finding this. It is pointless watching a film if you don`t have a clue what is going on.It would also be nice if you had some new films which weren`t Drug and gang related and aren`t full of foul moth rap music."
"My account just got stolen. and Netflix made it easy for them, sure I did get a email warning that something was going on, but I was at work and by the time I got home and saw the mail it was already to late... They had removed my email from the account and somehow even my phone number, why dont netflix use a simple ""you have to enter the security code we sendt to you on mail to change your email address"" or ""you have to enter the code we sendt you to your phone to change your phone number""  It's so simple and preventive for things like this. I am mad... Support is terrible to, you HAVE to call or login to your netflix account, witch I do no longer have access to!!!!"
"Love it, nice place to watch movies"
"Netflix charge you twice on your payment date, they claim they know nothing of the second payment and it doesn't show on your netflix account but does show on your bank account and your balance is reduced by the amount taken.  They keep the money for 48 hours then return it to your bank.  by doing this repeatedly with different customers they make a lot of interest on your money.  i cancelled my membership and will rejoin with an account that they can't abuse, they are a disgrace"
"Despite how much I hate the autoplaying trailers Netflix has used more and more recently, I have to thank them for their security warning when someone tried to change our account password. Thanks to the early warning, we were able to get in and protect our account before any further issues were taken. That proactive approach is much appreciated."
"Love it! Great selection of TV shows at fair monthly price.Compared to other streaming services, Netflix has much better interfaces and a more intuitive way of searching for something to watch."
"So I was going through billing today and realized that for the last 3 year netflix has double billed me each month and when I contacted the bank Visa only credits 60 days. Netflix says the maximum they reimburse is 26 dollars which can take up to 30 days...Naturally this wasnt okay with me so I got in contact with the supervisors who said sorry your out of luck and when I asked for a head office or higher up I got hung up on...soo 8.99 per month X 3 years ..Gone. That's not including the 8.99 I pay for the actual service under my REAL email. Not to mention they raised that price to 16.99 what was it 2 years ago now?. Please share this thread to raise awareness for the lack of customer service from a multimillion dollar company who has essentially been stealing from me  and knows how many more...üò°üò°"
"The service generally works well, except when it hiccups and keeps locking you out of your account (like, if you get a new phone, or replace your blu-ray player). Then the Indian rep (who will claim his name is 'Skip' while repeatedly mangling your first name in an attempt to sound friendly) repeats the mantra of 'reset your password' and unhelpfully insists on sending you a page of ""how to secure your account"" instructions that will contain such gems as ""don't share your password with strangers.""Note that checking my streaming history (once I got back in ) showed NO strange activity. Nobody watching House of Cards on my account in Bangalore or Pyongyang. It wouldn't be so irritating if they were just able to say: ""yeah, the system screws up every now and then."" But they can't. It's your fault somehow, so keep resetting your password (locked out, changed password, locked out again - for 3 days, this time). I hung up when 'Skip' said he wanted my payment card number (yes, this was at Netflix's toll-free number, the one on the website). Called back and waited 10 minutes for a supervisor who wanted me to change my password AND my email address. But she did get me back into my account, without asking for a credit card number. For now.That close to cancelling, but I have kids who simply must stare at screens. THAT close, though."
"I used to like Netflix and all that is available on it.  For the past couple of years, there has been so much garbage and blasphemous junk on Netflix that I am so disappointed in the streaming company. I am due to come to the end of subscription soon. They used to be nr One. I enjoy NOW tv entertainment package much more"
"If you have Netflix be careful cause they‚Äôve been over charging me for over a year now. I just thought they were increasing the cost of their service but they hadn‚Äôt increased their prices they were upgrading my plan without my knowledge.  They offered me a $3 refund ü§®ü§®ü§®. Overcharged now for a year and offered to give me $3 ü§îü§®. I have been a long standing customer. When I called Netflix and complained I was offered $3. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she just chose not to speak to me and hung up in my face."
"Sadly Netflix has really let me down. I used to be a big fan (back when Season 1 of the Crown arrived). In the past few years I've seen the service become complacent, with hardly any films or TV shows being worth watching. Perhaps Netflix isn't really for me, apparently Adam Sandler movies are the most popular thing on the platform and I'm definitely NOT a fan of his silly comedy films (although the Wedding Singer is great :)To be honest, most/all the recommend shows and movies are not interesting to me and I've had several issues with my account - they overcharged me, accidentally cancelled my account and then wouldn't accept my card when I tried to re-join a few months back. I think most of the films I'd like don't get added because I'm not their typical Adam Sandler loving customer. That's fair enough and I hate to write bad reviews, I just can't recommend them. They've gone downhill and don't seem to be improving. I did like the Irishman and several other films, but there's just not enough good new content on Netflix to be worth the monthly price.The thing is, they could be so good, especially considering the amount of money they spend on content, they could be the best, but they've become complacent (like a lot of other big companies that take their customers for granted)."
"Spent $170 on a gift card that was created for me, but ended up being invalid.Spent several hours on calls with their support.Best they could do, is offer 1 month free trial to help ""solve"" the issue.Again, I spent $170 (full year) and got $11 worth of subscription.Well played Netflix.Great way to treat your clients."
"I registered for the Free month trial (or only I thought it was for free). After that I was charged. I thought my money was only authorized but after a day I cancelled the plan and the money was not refunded. So I contacted the customer support. Their response:""Our system detected that a free trial was already used by you or someone in your household. Free trials are intended for a single household (not each individual within a household) to try Netflix before they decide to pay for our service.""ME: ""And how do I know it was used by someone else in the household? When I registered it was written in big red letters ""FREE TRIAL""""They:""We do not have technically information on how the system detected this. Our system checks all info identical from a new account created to all existing accounts. Once your account got active with us then system detected it is not eligible for it to use.""...after a long discussion, they decided to return my money"
"They took my money really early I called them got a refund they said on the phone to me it's not taken early I said I see it clearly here I told them how unhappy and greedy they are to take money super early like that I recommend if your gonna pay for Netflix that your card off immediately."
"At first they were good, now you have to wait for new releases. Lately we receive movies that are unplayable. Such a waste of time."
"Becomes boring rather quickly, I think that they are focused on the teenage audience and diversity way too much!"
"Great service and always improving its content. Easy to access and minimal problems with streaming content."
"netflix has a great range of original shows. I do wish they would change up the movies more frequently; especially in the horror genre."
"Just wish there was more range like Rambo and more arnold swartz movies but overall very happy with the serviceü§ôü§ô"
"If I could give a zero I would my netflix was hacked twice in one week. When I called because the password had been changed because I did not know my husband's credit card number by heart and he is working out of town they would not help me they said I could close that account and open a new one in my name. I asked is my credit card information is compromised and they said we dont think so but we can't guarantee it is not. Then when I ask what are you going to do to make sure my information is safe I get hung up on and sent to a survey the customer services is no help so be careful you are not being hacked at this moment people."
"I like Netflix but the fact that they put Gwyneth Paltrow goop lab on makes me angry. Her products have caused all kinds of problems and people have used her garbage but Netflix is giving her a platform to endorse her products. She is making money on hurting people with her inadequacy and ignorance. Shame on you Netflix."
"The absolute potential of Netflix is being reduced incredibly. One of the most amazing things is to watch a company attack its customers. The LGBT community is well covered in almost everything they produce. Even to the blasphemy of Jesus being gay. It is purposely driven to cls destruction. They have developed an incredible brand only to turn around and attack those who are either conservative or Christian. Literally attacking half of your profits. Truly a disappointment for the future of streaming entertainment. Amazon Prime is getting better all the time. Warning Netflix."
"Very poor service and movie service. Will not renew"
"Poor customer service , don't waste your time with Netflix, they are scammers, changed my credit card after the old one expired only to realize am being changed for both credit card but they refused  to issue the refundI was so mad. one customer agent told me I can stay on the phone complaning all day he is being paid by an hour,. So rude and arrogant."
"Watched a film deadly shore..honestly are people really like this in Canada..very unusual..the acting o my god"
"After reading the reviews on hear it has confirmed my thoughts about Netflix. I have been a member for some time &  It started Years ago when Knight rider series was on the UK site and all of a sudden it vanished? I did some research and it was on the US site but taken from the UK one? Apparently there are Hundreds if not thousands of shows the UK does not get that the US one does. This in itself is not acceptable.Something very wrong has happened to this service. Every time I log into it I end up spending half an hour searching for films and giving up wasting time and just logging out.They used to have 80s rare films (The keep) and I would enjoy seeing them reborn in HD. They just don't have anything like that any more and one of the most annoying things is they delete them from there server. Its not fair. Like someone else stated when you rate a movie it should keep it in your library and the ones you don't like should be not displayed.Over the previous Christmas period there were practically no proper Xmas films...How can this be??????What they are doing is putting major releases like Stranger things and the Witcher and deliberately cheeping out on the rest of the content. I do not consider stand up comedy shows or Indian films ""latest releases"". I don't have any need for this content at all.Its unfair to push it on everybody.The menu system is totally confusing..New, previous, this week - Talk about infuriating.I work in the cinema industry and know for a fact Netflix are not putting any previous films on that have been at Theatres. This is absurd in itself.There seems to be a general trend for this service to be turning into the BBC. They are basically trying to tell us what to think instead of watch and I for one am certainly not prepared to have to pay a fee for that. The service was "" Fun "" when it was created and now its just "" Infuriating"".There is literally no good content on it. The films are total rubbish with zero interest. I am constantly fed up with expecting new content and being greeted with last Months films being classed as new releases.The customer service is a joke and the staff arrogant.Netflix take note you need to up your game if you are to survive.Movies are something that helps a persons day to day life and not just a Money milking scheme to bleach the hell out of loyal customers. Where in your contract of sale does it state its ok to abuse the public in this way.I have had enough..No Xmas films at December was the last straw.I dont want or care for stand up comedy shows of someone making an absolute fool of themselves classed as latest releases or Indian films that have zero interest. You have tried to bleach everyone with mediocre content and your ship is sinking fast.I am cancelling my subscription and going to Amazon prime or other better choices than this total rubbish.Over ¬£100 a year for this total crap..No thanks."
"I love this! I love netflix.I suggest to fix it! Thanks"
"Scammed by Netflix with there 1 month free trail - another victim.AVOID ANY FREE TRAILS WITH NETFLIX - they only show repeats and old films that have been on the TV already and then charge you ¬£11.99 for something that was sold as a free trail, you have been warned.CEO-reed.hastings you can try and complain to this guy but this is probably part of his business plan for taking NETFLIX forward and make big profits by scamming people."
"Website stated '30-day free trial', Sign-Up SMS stated '30-day free trial' - Then they charged anyway and refuse to refund, stating ""System says no, you should not have been eligible due to your location""."
"How not to see a decent film - use Netflix. The few gems are totally swamped with trash or commercial BS that was screened years ago. As for the 'old' quality stuff - they must have a policy in Netflix not to make it available or something.It's alright for series, however."
"Netflix is crap waste of money! Even when it gets updated it‚Äôs mostly foreign films ... will be cancelling"
"Only joined because I was offered a free trial for 30 days. Not only did I not make it to 30 days, I didn't even make it two weeks, and they took a monthly payment off my credit card anyways! When I went to cancel the service after less than 2 weeks of starting it, they told me they were NOT giving me my money back. It was supposed to be a FREE 30 DAY TRIAL!!! Why was I cancelling the service? The shows kept freezing no matter how many times I turn my computer off and on and rewind the shows, mess with playback settings, etc. Huge waste of time and money."
"Good customer service! Resolved my query instantly"
"Clicked on a free trial link but I was charged for premium & when I phoned to complain they simply didn't care. Very poor customer service."
"Absolutely crap nothing on there I watch there is just one show my daughter watches and not enough to pay ¬£8 a month cancelled"
"UK Netflix is relatively cheap but it is also pretty poor. There are a few decent things to watch, but it doesn't take long before you've exhausted the good stuff and then spend more time scrolling than actually watching.This isn't necessarily just my opinion either... I'm constantly checking IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes for viewer ratings and, going by those, Netflix's catalogue is generally low quality (indeed, I think this is why Netflix don't tie in their app with those sites as you'd never select the play button on anything.)Hardly any 4K (Ultra HD) content either at the moment.Most definitely quantity over quality, with the very occasional surprise."
"Contacted customer service cuz I had an issue easily solved"
"Horrible Customer Service!  They charged me after I cancelled before the end of the 30 day free trial.  When I called to give them an opportunity to make it right, the customer service agent said it wasn't their problem it was mine.  Condescending and rude, good bye Netflix forever."
"I really like it but they need new movies and tv shows"
"Appalling customer service, they‚Äôve blocked me for no reason so I cant use my account but they won‚Äôt compensate me and the complaint will be dealt with by the supervisor so I have no way to upscale it.  Couldn‚Äôt care less about my inconvenience.  Waste of time and money"
"Horrible experience. Netflix advertised 1 month free trial which I signed up for. However my credit card was charged for this month which I only discovered 2 weeks later. Customer service manager said free trial is not available in Canada, BUT free trial for a month is their standard home page - DISGUSTING. There none good movies, vast majority of them are old, so cancelled my membership."
"Can't remember what I did before Netflix! changed the game."
"It appears I‚Äôm not part of the target audience Netflix Canada attempts to appeal to, so it‚Äôs hard to find something enjoyable amongst the shows and movies offered. When I see something appealing, such as an edgy crime drama, it usually turns out to be a foreign language film or series. I do paperwork while I view, meaning I listen more than watch, making such productions inconvenient for me. I can go for weeks without finding entertainment value on the Netflix platform, so I doubt I‚Äôll keep my subscription much longer."
"I think they should put Big Bang Theory on netflixüòÑ"
"Be aware that, even if you cancel your account online, if someone logs in (family member or hacker) it automatically restarts your membership and starts the billing cycle. You won't get your money back either, especially if there has been 'activity' on your account (even if not you and its fraudulent) its tough s**t. As far as they are concerned even if its been used fraudulently by a hacker it has to be paid for.This is now the second time that my account has been hacked. First time I rang up and was assured that it was now 'cancelled completely' after being used in Malaysia. Suddenly its now being used in London and i'm being billed for it even though it was cancelled via telephone staff. Telephone staff are useless.I'll never sign up to anything via automatic billing again and Netflix can stick it where the sun don't shine!"
"Netflix has repeatedly screwed up the website, the most egregious problem is that now there is no way to even SEE ""my list"", let alone manually reorder it. What they now call ""my list"" or ""my library"" is the same thing--a scroll through showing of the cover image for each title, which has to be clicked individually to get a description of that title. It leaves off at least two thirds of the items I actually have in my actual list, and there is NO WAY now to reorder anything at all. Until yesterday, I could still at least see my actual list to identify what titles are being removed this week and this month, although the manual reordering has been dysfunctional for over a month. Now it is completely gone, no way to even begin to see what I have let alone what's being removed or move any title to the top of my list. Customer service is totally unhelpful, most of the people I have spoken to recently barely speak English, don't understand what I'm talking about and keep wanting to send me the same stupid ""links"" to stuff on the help page, none of which will do anything but waste my time. Nothing gets fixed. However, they still continually want me to ""continue watching"" things I downvoted and removed from my list. Because surely if I hated a film in the first five or ten minutes, or even half an hour, if I just go back and continue watching this horrible item surely I'll like it? I think Netflix hates its customers. I've been using it over ten years, and every ""improvement"" they make is obviously done for the sole benefit of bored, incompetent tech people. I'm looking at BritBox and a few of the other streaming services starting up now. Surely these young and hungry companies will appreciate my business. IF ITS NOT BROKE DON'T FIX IT!!"
"Netflix signed us up for a Premium Account which we did not ask for, never used and we did not even know we had it.  Netflix have taken money from our bank account without our authorisation.  The Help Line: the staff were most UNHELPFUL."
"Literally every non-netflix movie you can watch on any other online site by watching one ad. I subscribed because of netflix made shows, movies and documentaries but they became way too political. Almost everything is filled with promotion of Lgbt population, but you can also find content that promotes drugs, polygamy and anti-russian propaganda."
"This review is so low as I recently had an issue updating card details after switching banks. Their site would not allow the details to be updated stating a problem with my bank. I decided to contact my bank to ensure no issue who advised me to contact Netflix by phone. I did so and it was the worst experience of customer service I have ever encountered. I was placed on hold for half an hour and told at the end they did not support my bank so nothing they could do. I then cancelled my membership and upon contacting my bank again I was informed I had been provided incorrect information by Netflix. I then restarted my membership with my new card details again entered and this time it worked. The customer service representatives are rude, unhelpful and incompetent at best."
"Wish we had the us selection here in the UK but other then that all good"
"Awful. Horror section is awful there isnt much to choose from and there super old films, really disappointed. No idea why there are films on there that are not English? They look good so I click on it but no, it's not english I just dont understand why you've done that?? The films that day are new are not, they have been on Netflix for a while so not sure about that either. I just hope it gets better or I'll have to stop paying as it's a waste of money"
"Netflix is great when it works but this low grade is in response to their customer service help.Been having trouble for a month trying to watch it and called several times over this period. Solution options have changed each time and still not working. When asked if can be credited for inconvenience they said no. When asking if I can discuss with a service manager told no. When asked if I can email my concerns told no: there is no email address.Staff member got agitated when asking for the above so I had to end call."
"No email customer support. After watching a movie it goes to the main page but you want to give a thumb up or thumb down so you have to search for that movie again.Nevertheless, Netflix adds new movies and documentaries every month so my opinion about this VOD is just average.Add email customer support and fix voting for movie and it will be 5/5."
"Today I tried to apply a ¬£25.00 gift card to my account.  The card was paid for a few weeks ago.  I applied the card to my account but it didn't work.  I tried again and the site said that the code was not valid.  I then sort help from their chat.  I can say that I have never had someone speak down to me like that before and found the advisor very unhelpful, before she even sorted out my problem she kept asking if if had any other questions.  I ask if I could speak to anyone else and was told ""No matter who you talk to, you will be asked to do the same instruction as we are just following the same steps here in Netflix"".  I have now been told that I have to wait 24 hours and try this again.  All I want is to be able to use my account but have not had any ""help"" from Netflix."
"BAD QUALITY STREAMS DESPITE FIBER BROADBAND !Poor customer service,Very charming before taking payment, horrible after !"
"I‚Äôve had Netflix for several years, but while they increased the price the quality had gone down. Same movies on for months on end, and an increase in foreign subtitled films, especially India. The videos often stutter and buffer. I‚Äôve had enough of paying through the nose for the same old films."
"Rubbish films, takes ages to find something worth watching and most of the recently added films are years old. Also seem to be getting more and more foreign films with subtitles! Can't remember the last time I saw a blockbuster listed."
"WARNING! READ URGENT! NETFLIX ALLOW YOUR NETFLIX ACCOUNT TO BE LOGGED IN BY OTHER PEOPLE. MY ACCOUNT DETAILS CHANGED TODAY AND THEY TOOK HAD NO EMPATHY TO DEAL WITH IT"
"M√°s temporadas de Icarly Sam y cat victorius por favor"
"Removed a series I was watching with no notice.  I am very disappointed with Netflix and  will be using Amazon Prime instead."
"Best shows without ads. I like this approach. Moreover, they have many original series. It should be promoted."
"There‚Äôs not too much to say about Netflix. There‚Äôs such a huge selection of movies and tv shows, so you‚Äôre guaranteed to find a few things you like. The problem is that with those things you will like, there‚Äôs a whole lot there that you won‚Äôt. You could spend an hour before you find something to watch."
"Netflix is a good app and i love whatchinf stuff on it. BUT SINCE YOUVE TAKEN FRIENDS OFF THE APP IS USELESS. you all need to bring friends back it was a great show. thanks"
"Terrible you pay threw the nose for the same boring movies , nothing ever new just old films they seem to update one movie A month what a load of s%!t!! Prime is so much better"
"Netflix decided to take the best show of all time on 1/1/20  ‚Äú friends‚Äù now I have no reason to keep using Netflix since they decided to take off my favorite show !"
"Ok programs and movies, way too many movies from India. Biggest problem with that is I'm from the USA and don't enjoy the culture as much as what I am used to... if I wanted Indian movies I'd rent indian movies , there for I canceled my subscription.  Thanks anyway. .."
"The reception is awful, the program kept skipping and dragging...it was very irritating and we ended up turning it off. I will not recommend Netflix to anyone. Very unsatisfied."
"Garbage for your money!Own on dvd or digital 99% of the good content already. Other pirate streaming services are available already, and will be forever. Unless streaming services can offer a good quality film or program each month, its not worth the sub. Not in any way.The app itself is so annoying to use that it makes you want to close it ."
"I had signed up for a free trial, got the premium deal, a few days in and I was requested to update my payment info. Got charged 9.99‚Ç¨. The explanation was that ‚ÄúI was recognized for having experienced Netflix before‚Äù. What the? Why is that a reason to charge me WITHOUT WARNING? I was using a new debit card and nowhere does it say I can‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm waiting for my refund now. Never using this garbage app again."
"I cant find any good shows or movies they take them all down and put dumb shows/ movies that no one wants to watch but they did just team up with nick thats it"
"The amount is good viewing and quality series is terrible.Large percentage of foreign language films, B rated films and dreadfull series."
"It's poor. There's absolutely nothing on there at all. I guarantee you will spend more time looking for a movie or series than the duration of said movie or episode. New seasons take forever to come out and the movies are terrible. They started charging even more as they were increasing their selection of movies, however, (and this is a big however) the majority of the new movies were in foreign languages. IThe only reason this isn't 1* is because I haven't cancelled my subscription yet and I know I'm going to have problems when I do. 1 extra star for optimism and faith."
"After 2 million petitions to cancel a show  Netflix do nothing about it. If you had a homophobic or racist show on Netflix it wouldn't last a day and rightly so but somehow it's fine to mock Christianity."
"Having a movie making Jesus gay is ok? Nah. Screw you Netfilx. We will take our money elsewhere."
"Lame. There's nothing I want to watch. Not even worth 9 quid."
"Because they steal my time with ads and so on...Last weeks it is not possible to easy jump back in time for a 10s. It takes ages. 20s is not possible at all. Movies are crap. Series are much better. First what is loaded are ads. The slowest respose ever. Not able to ban specific trailers. Autoplay is not able to turn off. Why this crap is not free if charge???So fckng long fckrs!"
"The video streaming is well done and almost always works well. I just think personal content management is somewhat limited. They may offer multiple subscription plans."
"The supposed ""free trial"" in the UK isn't actually free, it's a free upgrade meaning they still take money out of your account.

"The supposed ""free trial"" in the UK isn't actually free, it's a free upgrade meaning they still take money out of your account. Very misleading, can't get my money back and the customer service have an attitude.They never have a full series of films in a saga and rarely have good films on."
"Love African movies. Put more"
"Security is severely lacking. My account was hacked, but Netflix wouldn't accept responsibility. Account was then cancelled by customer support, and I lost usage that I had already paid for.Complete bunch of cowboys.Content ok, but prone to cancelling shows I have invested time in.All in all, I would look elsewhere."
"I have tried to watch over a dozen different shows on Netflix and I have noticed in every single case, that their shows always include (or add to the existing material the shows were made from) gross, disgusting, or usually totally immoral, and in some cases down right sick and twisted content.Spoiler alert: Example Netflix made up the bit about people being tricked and turned into eels in Witcher.Proves how sick in the head Netflix are and how the most vile of us are now deeply embedded in entertainment."
"Thought the Witcher might bring netflix back,  Guess not, all the potential is there but an 8 episode season and then wait 1+ yrs for another season isnt anywhere near cutting it, goodbye netflix youve dug your own grave with cutting good shows and not putting out enough content anywhere near quick enough. R.I.P"
"I‚Äôm very disappointed with Netflix service they keep letting people Steel my email and change my email account and when I try to call them  They give me a run around"
"I've been a customer for a few years. I have also stopped subscribing before to save money. I know that their catalog is always changing and some people get upset when their favorite series disappears after a decent run, but I'm impressed with the variety and original content. I have few complaints for them as a business. I would like to see prices lowered or a loyalty perk, but I understand the model."
"Anti Christian corporation. Constantly offending Christianity and Christians ‚òß!!!"
"Haven't really bothered with Netflix much but The Witcher got me thinking about signing up for a month. Soon as I logged in I see their plans have gone up another ¬£2 lol.Great business model - cut content but charge more. That's why Sky are being blown out of the water these days. Netflix is next. Disney, Prime and the other hundred streaming services are pushing this towards redundancy and they've had it coming."
"Very confused as to why Netflix management have no knowledge of what an authorization code is. This is needed to legally take card payments. Im simply asking them to give it to me to reverse a payment that they have taken from my bank account. Over the last 24 hours i have been communicating to and fro the bank and Netflix customer service. There have been multiples of phonecalls backwards and forwards to try and resolve this matter. Netflix management are even refusing to accept the simple instructions i have been given from my bank. My issue is not being resolved so i am asking to escalate my complaint...i get told i cannot speak to anybody higher than the current call handler; which is obviously a lie. I suggest you watch your money with this company as they seem to be very unaware of the rules and regulations when handling financial transactions."
"Netflix is a useless anti christian website stay away.Netflix decided to wage a war on Christianity, no problem at all but don't expect that Christians will ever use you again.To the creators of this website, perhaps you will earn money from promoting hatred however remember that one day you won't be on earth that's what you want to people remember you for? Shame on you."
"Talked with customer service about removing offending materials regarding Christ. They said they will never remove it. What will they make next to offend us...a holocaust comedy or how Allah or Mohammed is gay?Where does creativity vs offending others stop? Why has Netflix stopped being family friendly? Would you want your children to watch these shows?"
"The options show in Netflix about God being in love with the Devil are so despicable, indecent. This company is blaspheming when posting outrageous movies. They need to be band from playing any movies. I am very dissatisfied with their shows."
"It can only be one star based solely on NETFLIX's lousy customer service ... not answering 2 registered letters send directly to HQ in Los Gatos (April and October 2019) really is extremely bad ... and then, when chatting with customer ""service"" online, they cannot (or are not allowed) to answer simple questions as to whom I could then contact in this matter ... I rest my case!"
"Terrable customer service. Often take double or triple amounts that are pending by your bank even though the account has been payed. Customer service will not accept any wrong doing for taking triple out of my account before it bouncing back. For me this is unprofessional from a corporate and I will not be returning.Rude, obnoxious, corporate giant that needs kicking down"
"Yer losing 2 stars cause you keep asking if I'm still watching!!! I WILL TURN IT OFF WHEN I'M DONE!!!!!"
"If it were possible to give you ten stars you would get it. Thank you, you listened to your viewer and acknowledged and responded with k drama. I no your prices will more than likely go up. Just keep in mind without your customers there would be no Netflix and be considerate when you do increase your rate. No longer will customers have to be at the mercy of Viki Rakuten and there professionalism when it comes to there programs. You finally got it!  Thank you"
"Simple, lots of series, inexpensive"
"I called back in September as my account had been hacked, changed and reset everything, discovered today that when hacked they changed account from standard to premium, only noticed as email to say account to ecpire tomorrow however i know  paid for more than a year in advance by gift card. Call for help ecxpecting that the unauthorised money returned to account - only to be told by the less tahn helpful member of netflix - 'i keep an eye on my account and I pay for it by gift card, you should have noticed'. Plus they won't refund the account or extend the time of the account to cover the loss as I paid on a gift card. The supervisor did nothing more to help but was less rude although his tone was not great. Result I have a mail address to write a letter too. Well done Netflix you have excelled in incompetence."
"Netflix disappoint me a lot!! It is incredible to allow such a film to be broadcast against Jesus! Shame of you!!!"
"This streaming services is a mess! It offends Christians everywhere by putting us in a position to give up their services and more so to act against them! It is incredible to allow such a film to be broadcast against the Jesus! I will recommend different streaming services without a doubt! I cannot look anymore at this name ""net-flics"" which acts without any shame against what is noble, clean and healthy! Shame of you!!!"
"You don‚Äôt get a full month when you pay for a full month. They cut you off early. I‚Äôll enjoy the class action law suit for not providing a full month of service."
"Nothing good to watch, films update with more awful films...zero Christmas films.Probably the worst of all the streaming films/series."
"During the period of offer for the free period of try and buy of 30 days the got money from my paypal because found double registration with the same email at the same day.Be carefully the are not polite."
"This streaming services is a mess! It offends Christians everywhere by putting us in a position to give up their services and more so to act against them! It is incredible to allow such a film to be broadcast against the Son of God! I will recommend different streaming services without a doubt! I cannot look anymore at this name ""net-flics"" which acts without any shame against what is noble, clean and healthy! Shame of you!!!"
"Nothing worth watching, ive searched for so many films and they have none of them, a COMPLETE waste of money, Cancelled my membership.People don't bother with them !Much better offerings out there"
"I signed up to Netflix this afternoon, stupidly believing it to be a streaming service with a great range of the latest films. How wrong I was - I searched for several favourites including Elf, Jurassic Park II, The Greatest Showman, Lion King etc. None of these are in the Netflix catalogue, which is staggeringly poorly stocked, and cannot be viewed before you sign up.. I cancelled my subscription immediately, and phoned my credit card provider, who told me that Netflix had already taken the payment within minutes of signing up. I have not watched any films on Netflix and warn others not to be sucked into this money-grabbing machine. I'll be talking to the disputes team of my credit card provider when they open on Monday, but I don't expect to see my first subscription refunded from this  company.  Be warned, potential Netflix users!"
"I watch Netflix daily! I love the variety as well as the original content they produce."
"Hate your new format, it even more confusing to use your  Seriously thinking thinking about disconnecting serviceyou keep raising your rates for what?"
"I love Netflix. Im using this platform for a year and i like content there."
"The movies suck on Netflix. Nothing good to watch for 16$ a month."
"We had Netflix services for 5 years or more.The price has gone up and up. Many other streaming services (most major) offer more services for less money.The layout is not conducive to finding new materials. Old layout that desperately needs an update.The only reason we kept Netflix, for the past 2 years or so, was kid content.The moment Disney plus dropped, we purchased a year subscription and dropped Netflix like a hot potato.Better programming and a savings of over $100/year!"
"The price seems to keep going up while other streaming companys are getting cheaper. Also needs more current movies."
"Netflix is so bad, they are really slow at putting movies and series on, the series and movies that they do put on are crap and un heard of, and they constantly take down the good movies."
"Never want - never ask for NETFLIX but get e mails everyday from themSCAMMERS!!!!"
"Very good OTT platform. I've been using for a long time and I am always amazed by the quality content."
"I was using Netflix without any problem until recently my card payment was declined. Netflix customer support could not find any solution yet recommended to try with a different card. Even the second card is showing the same message and they are not able to solve the problem. Bad experience!"
"Just horrible.  For months, I have been fighting with them to cancel my membership.  I have had my account open for years, and have forgotten which email address is associated with the account. I know they have the ability to cancel my membership, yet they refuse to do so unless I can provide the email address.   My God, I hate this company."
"Netflix has security issues with a lack of customer service skills. If you enjoy chasing down hackers and fighting to Keep your money then certainly sign up for Netflix. But don‚Äôt expect any help or security from Netflix."
"Didn't even get to sign up! Got an error message when trying to pay via Paypal option. Ok, I'll use my debit card then - nope, another error message. Tried online chat for support but they just were not helpful.Doesn't bode well does it? I'll not bother then. NOT impressed."
"so much shi% there nowadays, it used to be a decent platform, now plenty of stupid, American comedies"
"Three times I've tried to call about issues and each time I have to explain everything then times over, but keep getting put on hold for long periods, to then be asked the same things again. Eventually just when I think I'm getting somewhere the call gets cut off and goes to their 45 second feedback. Needless to say it's not been positive and my issue still isn't resolved.They sound American, and I thought the Americans blew their own trumpet about being great in the service industry.....clearly not customer service."
"Lots of content, and easy to set up an account, payment, users etc.Only downside is when My List doesn't update with things I've already seen, or something stays on my Watchlist because I didn't watch the last 20 seconds of something.Should add IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings to content - saves Googling it."
"Every film I want to watch is unavailable. I can watch kill Bill 2 what about kill Bill. Can't watch pulp fiction, can't watch pretty woman, donnie darko, back to the future, crossroads and so the list goes on in my opinion f---k waste of money"
"Most Of The best shows are cancelled or you have to wait Months fit new seasons like Hannibal and Ozark. There's currently no batman films at all in the UK on Netflix or Spiderman films or star wars!! All I seem to get is crappy films that are in terrestrial TV there are some good things but not even family guy or Simpson's anything that is owned by somebody seems to not be on there I've had enough."
"The reason Netflix no longer allows reviews is because the reviews were becoming truly horrible.The selection is becoming worse and worse. I watch Mostly repeats  now . There are less and less available ""in your country (US)"". Often I'll. exit the movie halfway through and when I come back it is gone. Meanwhile, the cost of Netflix goes up.What happened to the selection? Why has Netflix fallen apart? Switching to another app."
"I had a very bad experience with Netflix customer service as i called 5 people and i did chat with 2 people to solve my issue bt nothing done till now !!!!!!! Only asking me to delete Netflix n download it again n again n no one cares!!!!One of the customer service agent called Ahmed in customer service bulgaria or athena (i forget) (because of the number of people I called) he hung up the phone 2 times while I‚Äôm talking to him I ll cancel my subscription due to this bad experience"
"Funny how Netflix gives all of their own movies and TV shows a 5 stars and they are really far from it! I am tired of when I look on my menu most of my stuff is all Netflix originals and Netflix movies Netflix Netflix Netflix yall aint that good! Go back to your original business model. You're getting way too expensive and I don't turn you on just so that I can watch all of your stuff! I will be canceling."
"The service itself is great but when I clicked on my viewing account it showed my account had been used in areas of the country I've never been in. I contacted customer services and they didnt even understand what I was saying nor did they speak good English themselves. I was concerned about the security of Netflix as you have to enter card details and advisor just said ok is that all you need to tell me and then said have a good day and hung up. I have since cancelled my contract and gone to now tv."
"Great Streaming Company, which seems reliable and updates theirs shows on a regular basis. I would love to see list a blog or newsletter of upcoming shows over the next 6months, to be tailored to shows I love. There seems to be lots of bad reviews but some appear to relate to internet connection. However I have never had an issue with the service, but I have 80mps fibre broadband."
"i think that its good and bad because i cant watch  a fracking Christmas movie but its great service"
"Hate that I can't see my shows when traveling!"
"PERFECTI dont know why some review here is 1 or 2 stars. The netflix is perfect"
"Go woke get broke. Otherwise dope service and worthy."
"Make sure to keep an eye on your bank statement. I have been double charged over 1 year and I was like what the heck? I called them what they said your account was compromised....then???? Nothing happened I got only 1 month refund and keep on going for a couple months. Called and reached supervisor guy name called Enrique. He says we are not able to get your money back...I‚Äôm pretty sure even dollar store would give your money if you got charged twice for no reason. Thanks Netflix to charge me twice a month you guys are literally best scammers"
"Charged my account without my consent because they 'detected' I've already had a 30 free trial which I've never had"
"I give 1 star because I can't give ZERO stars. What a scandalous support service and ineffective way to deal with the most stupid of problems. When you are inept the most easy option is to blame the other side, the 'ENEMY', your Customers. I was upgraded to a Subscription Plan I didn't request or authorize after inquiring for options. Impossible to solve the problem, only cancelling the subscription. You ask me if I feel like renewing? LOL@14.Feb.2020:Got a note with a request for a 'Reunification' but the Truth is that I don't remember having married NETFLIX in the first place. How about a 'Sincere Apology' before tying the tie again... Sometimes I miss them, until you remember that Service is about Customer Support."
"Fraud policies are a joke. Essentially my account got hacked and Netflix did not care one bit. My account email and password were changed by someone in Morocco and apparently the only way to recover your account is to give them all of your secure payment information...over the phone....after your account was just hacked, not really something I want to do. No company has EVER asked me for my all of my paypal account information. So sketchy. The only other option is to cancel your account entirely, which you have absolutely no proof that your account has actually been cancelled besides taking the representatives word for it. They then tell you to go online and just sign up for a new account. What a joke. I had previously been very happy with Netflix but this experience has shown me how very very little Netflix AND it's customer service reps care about their customers. Very sad, I will not be signing up again."
"Quiero que salga en Netflix gravity falls con las 2 temporadas i pokemon, final space, Rick and Morty.... Sacar todas las TEMPORADAS COMPLETAS!!!"
"Netflix deactivated my account due to fro duke today usage from a third world country but continued to charge my account. I called them trying to get a refund for the month or a free month of service since I was not able to use it. They could not and would not do anything to make this right. It is unbelievable to me that a company that gross 950mil/month would lose a customer over less than 20 dollars. I canceled my account and went to amazon prime."
"Ok so I didn‚Äôt really watch much TV so I cancelled Netflix but OMG they have the easiest, quickest and most beautifully simple cancellation procedure!Basically I googled cancel Netflix. I got a page with ‚Äòfinish cancellation?‚Äô and a button to press.  It took 2 clicks. TWO!  Every company should do this. It makes a change from needing to navigate to the 25th page, enter your shoe size, give a reason why you are cancelling, give your next of kin and then re-enter the card details you used to subscribe with. Well done Netflix. I cancelled and you were big enough to just accept it.I might even re-subscribe I‚Äôm so impressed"
"People there themselves have no idea how the Netflix platform works. Just *facepalm*"
"I love Netflix's content however over the past few months have found it unwatchable to the extent I'm going to have to cancel.50 Mbps internet connection and netflix cannot cope. Programmes either just hang and don't play at all or they play and the picture is ridiculously blocky.Now TV, iPlayer, 4OD, itv hub and prime video all work with no issues whatsoever - so I know it's not the connection etc."
"Restarted my account and found out this morning I got billed twice. First for the first month and second for last month.. in which they interrupted service. Contacted them and they said the money for the extra charge would be back on there in 30 days. How crazy. You know this is not right.. they stole my money and I don't believe them that my $14.94 will be back on my card. They did not even file a refund.. just gave me the general message. It's not cool this is a million dollar if not billion dollar company and we are poor and to still this amount really burns me up."
"Terrible update. Movie Info attached to the movie cover swallows the whole screen. Impossible to find anything"
"Double billed. The call center is SO LOUD you have a hard time understanding."
"Netflix makes excuses for what is fast becoming very poor service. Not only is their DVD by mail service going downhill fast but their streaming service is a absolute mess. It is designed for compatibility with Smart TVs, Microsoft OS or cellphones only and other systems WILL have major issues like sound without picture, losing your place in a series and having to go through disc by disc or season by season to find where you were at. Small wonder they are having so much difficulty and their cutbacks are only making it worse for them."
"Customer support help me setup with error code on new TV"
"It's working fine on my TV but i need some updates and customer support is not good everything is alright."
"Netflix, like Comcast, has gone to all foreign customer service agents. Some of them are very courteous and helpful, though a little slow at times.Netflix has foreigners now with an attitude. So it's not enough that they can't understand what you need help with, then there's the attitude also. I got one today who did not know the difference between closed captioning and subtitles. I opened up with that I was having trouble with subtitles and closed captioning, and she immediately leaped to the conclusion that I meant I did not want them. So frustrating. I used to be so happy with their customer service people. All Americans who were friendly and helpful. If they keep up skimping on customer service, both Netflix and Comcast will be out of business and good riddance."
"Terrible costumers service. They offered apparently a free month trial and then they charged me 11.99 Euros out of my card. When I contacted them they lady told me that someone or myself has already used the free trial service. I asked her which kind of proof she have and she told me that the system shows her that it has being used. So basically  she could'nt provided me any kind of proof of her statements and they charged me money. Definiditly there is a big decivement, really dissapoinment."
"Shows and movies suck, costs way too much to find nothing with hours invested in scrolling and searching. Cancelled their service and then they still proceeded to charge me until I had to provide proof of cancellation (email they sent when I cancelled) they still gave me a hard time. Will never reactivate a lame service such as Netflix again."
"Really not bad. I am sure people would complain regardless but I am watching  movie on Netflix"
"Last time I checked I live in England to many subtitled films and foreign film not enough new films spend up to an hour trying to find something worth watching gone right down hill Netflix"
"please put the secret life of american teenager back on!!!"
"I mean it‚Äôs a okay platform but the movie selection is bad and same with the tv show selection the only good shows on there are the office and friends. And the only good movie on there is IT, scream and Christmas with the Kranks"
"If I could give Netflix a zero I definitely would at this point. I think it's really unfair to have people that pay their hard-earned money, and are now unable to get Netflix on their TVs if it's an older model which is very unfair. I think this is going to cause a lot of people to drop Netflix because I am one of them people that are going to drop Netflix now because of the way they treat their customers which is horrible plus the shows on Netflix aren't that great anyway HULU is the best!!!!!!!!"
"the shows are really limited but the platform has a lot of potential"
"Poor quality films, far to many foreign films, this is England, if foreigners want to live here learn the bloody language,they also don't add enough films, they seem to think changing the picture on old movies makes it a new addition, waste of money can watch most of the movies on you tube for nothing"
"For the price, Netfix is poor.This is a Streaming only service but costs more than comparable competitors which also provide additional servicesThe content contains a very significant percentage of low grade shows and movies.The interface and search option is awfulThere is no ready catalogueThere are plenty of good shows...they are just hidden by all the dross!"
"Just nothing I want to watch, or haven't watched already, padded out with dross, and a truly awful app layout.Have had far more fun with Channel 4's Walter Presents, which is free."
"It is great in terms of content but in UX wise it is really bad. I mean it keeps recommending me the movies or tv shows that I watched and rated already. It is a shame for a company like Netflix to have such average system."
"It's ok but not better than this site videotime.cf"
"I‚Äôve had Netflix for a few years now and absolutely love it, I always have plenty to watch and love that you can download things to watch offline."
"Watching movies there is great experience but, it's expensive for me so i tested only the free trial."
"Netflix sucks. Might as well buy a fire stick...SERIOUSLY. It's been almost a year and only the same old movies are still available.  No large variety just OLD movies you've seen a MILLION times. Trust me on this. I canceled service today I seen movies in there from the 70s...oh hell no. Your few dollars a month add up for the antique movies, dont waste it anymore ON NETFLIX."
"Hello there how are you doing today and your health over there"
"Cause the search engine is bad, hard to find movies...Really low quantities from the films...How is possible??? In 2012 had more movies...Low numbers of the movies, shows which has been dubbed...."
"I pay $17 a month for this service because I can't afford cable TV, but this service ends up being removed from devices. I can't afford to go out and buy a new TV or Blue Ray when this happens. I like to watch the big screen in my living room, not on some hand held device that is difficult for someone with MS."
"Your issue is: Why is blacklist new season without legends ?

"I love Netflix! However, I need for Spongebob Square pants to be a show on Netflix as well. Please and thank you!"
"The best streaming service out there. Literally."
"Put Friday night dinner Full episode on it!"
"The well known Netflix does not have enough good films to compensate the charges everyone has to pay for a proper experience.For instance, I couldn‚Äôt find some very good tv series such as Band of Brothers, The Pacific to name a few.It‚Äôs not entirely useless but just not satisfying enough and there is plenty of room for more improvements."
"Why does every show, series and movie have gay and lesbian couples in them now? Not a few but EVERY. I don't want to see two men going at it or kissing in everything I watch. It doesn't matter whether it's legalized or not, it's wrong, and I don't want it forced down my throat. Those that choose that are fine with me. I have no problem with that. But I just don't want to see it, nor watch it in everything I watch. Nor would I ever want my child seeing anything that shows things like that. Not sure if it's some type of subliminal message or what but it's ridiculous. I am not gay nor do I approve of it.  I could care less who this offends because it isn't right and forcing us to watch it doesn't make it anymore right. Still wrong."
"Not enough variation of content over the course of a month. Too much of what is available is low budget   foreign language films. Don't get me wrong, I like many foreign language movies but these on Netflix are jjunk.Some of the series are good but they seem to follow the modern trend of continual new seasons with no closure.Not worth the monthly fee"
"Netlfix is just like every other movie streaming website. It has shows and movies that were made spacifically for Netflix but it is lacking the area of offering everything people are looking for. Constantly removing and adding different shows, not offering all the things that Hulu or other sites are."
"I got billed for premium instead of standard, after contacting support they just 'apologised for the inconvenience'."
"The platform could implement more shows, but the netflix originals are absolutely amazing! I am not Uhtred, and I am not son of Uhtred, but his story is amazing!"
"Very stable site, ridiculous amount of content, only thing keeping it from 5 stars is their ""Are You Still Watching?"" annoyance. If I want to stream background noise, I should be able to... I am paying for it."
"Never a problem been with them years quality company"
"I don't understand all these negative reviews. Netflix is the only legal way I can see so many movies and series. I have watched Netflix for hundreds of hours. It's a really great website."
"Very disappointed !!!!So much trouble asking to log in SEVERAL TIMES, why ???I told to my friends to look for something else anyway..."
"Great value for money considering you can just binge in the free trials. Although you can't change the video speed, there's a chrome extension called 'Video Speed Changer' that lets you watch stuff sped up."
"first of all they don't have updates on the shows or movies. the sames things could stay for many months. they are not that high quality shows. they have the worst worst Customer Service and very rude. For example I live in Greece but I asked them to have Arabic Subtitles. A nice guy made the settings from his side and I had the Arabic Subtitles over a year. My daughter used my account and changed it to Greek. So I have contacted them to return the Arabic subtitles but they kept talking about the license and nonsense.  If you live in a certain country, it doesn't necessarily you speak or read the local language. you have to have what is suitable for your needs and the company's' needs.  I have chatted with them many times but they were talking like Robots, eventually they were talking very rudely.  I will copy the conversation to see how rude they are ""YouI live in Greece. I had Arabic subtitles over a year on my account. Now I can't have Arabic subtitles. I need you to make the necessary settings from your side to have Arabic subtitles again. I ve' chatting with one of your CS for over an hour to solve the issue. I have canceled my account and agreed to reactivate it so as to solve this issueVaughn Rouge NetflixHi, this is Vaughn from Netflix! I can surely help you with your inquiry above. Just a quick reminder, your timely response will help me get your issue resolve in the most efficient manner, okay?You********************Vaughn Rouge NetflixUpon checking here you cancelled the account then we refunded you 13.99 EUR. However, you reactivated your account just now, is that correct?Youcorrect. a colleague of yours was trying to help me to solve the issueVaughn Rouge NetflixOkay. And I believe you are not seeing Arabic subtitles for your shows. Can you tell me one example of a show you are watching where you want Arabic subtitles?YouI watched 4 seasons of Brookly 99 in Arabic. My daughter used my account and she switched it to Greek. I can't choose Arabic subtitles from side because I live in GreeceYoupreviously a colleague of yours changed the setting and added Arabic to may account from his side as a special serviceVaughn Rouge NetflixLet me try to change your Netflix profile language to Arabic, then I want you to try checking Brooklyn nine-nine again to see if you get the Arabic subtitles.Youthank youVaughn Rouge NetflixThere you go, I changed the profile language of the first profile to Arabic - can you open Netflix on any device now, then check Brooklyn nine-nine if Arabic subtitles are available? (note: this is not guaranteed as we are just doing this as a test)Youno. I want to keep everything in the original language. I need only subtitles. My children can't read ArabicYouI had the background in English but the subtiles were in ArabicVaughn Rouge NetflixOkay. Again we are just doing this to see if you can get Arabic subtitles this way. But otherwise, I want to inform you that sometimes subtitle languages leave Netflix due to licensing agreements/copyright issues per region, especially if you're in a different country. So there will be no way we can get you back Arabic subtitles right away. The best we can do is take this as a feedback so we can see what we can do about it.Youok. first step is to get the first setting please and remove the Arabic.Vaughn Rouge NetflixI've changed your profile language back to English now.Yousecond to check how you can get me back the Arabic subtitles.Youok.Vaughn Rouge NetflixAs I've checked here, Arabic subtitles are no longer available on Brooklyn nine-nine. Again, the reason behind it is because of licensing agreements/copyright issues per region, especially if you're in a different country. There's nothing we can do for now to bring back the Arabic subtitles as it goes through a long process first, so the best we can do is take this as a feedback from you.Youok. Please don't give me the ready answers about the liecense. I have canceled my account because of this. could you escelate the issue please and try to find a solutionYouIf you gave me subtitles for almost everything on Netflex the first time, then for sure you can give me this service againVaughn Rouge NetflixWe've already exhausted our resources here and again, as much as we would love to give you Arabic subtitles, there is nothing we can do as again it goes through a long process.You??????Vaughn Rouge NetflixArabic subtitles are only available on selected shows per country. You can Click Here, change the Subtitle language to Arabic, then you can see which shows/movies are available in Arabic subtitles.Youthat is the most insulting service. I exhausted you? you are paid to work certain hours to serve customers like me! I have scree shot the text and believe me am sharing it on social media and complaining about you . I want you to cancel my account again and immediately otherwise I will escelate to paypalVaughn Rouge NetflixOkay and how would you like to proceed with the charge?Youcancel the account and return any charges to my pay palVaughn Rouge NetflixAlright I've just cancelled your account effective immediately and processed the refund for 13.99 EUR back to your PayPal.

Have a good one! Goodbye for now."
"you can lose your job if you are always on netflix ,its that addictive"
"I like most things about Netflix.  The one thing that drives me nuts it they don't separate the foreign language or subtitled shows.  Some are good I'm sure but, I don't want to read a move; I want to watch it.  And I don't want to want something I can't understand.  The ought to make it clear in the description or show them separately."
"It's an ideal place to spend your lonely evenings. Not expensive, full of new TV shows. Recommend!"
"Three quarters of the available programmes are absolute unwatchable tripe. Very difficult and awkward to navigate around the site, which just adds to the misery of the experience. Will be unsubscribing in due course."
"Netflix has lost all likeability with customers and a falling behind on the good tv shows. they keep making their own badly written shows and floods the market selection with really no selection wanted. they keep throwing their original series in ur face like u are on youtube and not using a paid service that shouldn't have any ad interruptions or forced upon us to see the trailer. It wasn't a problem when netflix was just promoting good shows but they are showing me and my son horror movie trailers and i couldn't find the remote, my son cries from being scared. thanks netflix..."
"Absolutel rubbish wanted to watch peaky blinders but wouldn‚Äôt let me watch it absolutely fuming needs to be banned"
"Netflix, thank you for being able to select an option to see the entire credits of a movie after the finish. Previously, the credits would only last mere seconds before jumping to the next ‚Äúpreview,‚Äù leaving the viewer jarred and not being able to digest what was just seen. The ability to select full credits results in the viewer being able to enjoy any given movie literally from beginning to end."
"Going dowhill fast this must be the6th time ive stopped my subscription. Utter tripe selection. Pandered towards the snowflakes.  No thanks...."
"great site for binge watching your favorite shows"
"I've always been happy with Netflix and really like their original content like 'The Crown'. Unfortunately, in the last year, they've gone seriously downhill with everything else. The content is getting worse by the week. Although there are hundreds of good American movies released every year in the US and Canada, Netflix is now choosing to go with cheap garbage from India, Africa, Spain, and Mexico. It's gotten so there's more foreign content than American, and half the American content is cartoons or violence. Going downhill fast!"
"I had a bad experience with Netflix. I did register my credit card for a couple of months to watch movies over the mobile. I could not continue according to special situations so that I terminated my Netflix account. The tricky part that Netflix does not allow you to remove the credit card from your profile. furthermore, they don't advise you either the way to remove it which is only through the call centre. After the service has been stopped within two weeks I realised that someone hacked my account and watched the movies over the web portal. Taking into consideration that I am an IT guy and put a complicated password. I tried to cancel the membership again as they returned back automatically and refund back the payment with no avail. They forwarded me to make a claim through the bank which is frustrating. The conclusion that Netflix is not a secured portal so that I never recommend it at all."
"Took ¬£5.99 monthly fee and ¬£5.99 aithorisation fee which they are keeping from me for 30 days...mean ehile gainibg interest in their account Would not tell me.who they are regulated by someone named Ashish Indian office a supervisor and would not tell me"
"I have had my account deactivated for more than 1 year, then I get a message that if I want to come back I can get 1 month free. I then choose to use this and know they will contact me 4 days before it expires.The day after, I discover that they have still withdraw money from my account and contact their so-called customer service. Here I am told that he can do nothing and if there is anything else he can help me with?You have then lost yet another customer with fake advertising and click bait!"
"This December 1st 2019 announcement of devices not working is total crap! The list contains devices that will work but doesn't recommend time length!? Total B.S. that BOTH our flat screens will not work in a few months and they are only a few years old! Money-grubbing A-Holes! I will move to Prime and get free shipping, butt clowns!"
"Joined 2 days ago, trial, low quality, survey it‚Äôs a sh***y waste of time, can‚Äôt say what I want to say. If image quality is sooooo low during trial, why would I pay monthly??? It‚Äôs lower than 4 years ago, I was wrong trying to get back to Netflix. So disappointed, feel like going outside and shout/roar"
"Good app - need to add more movies and tv series."
"im addicted. after i watched the office for the 79th time, i was taken back to rehab where the hid me in the back so no one could see me and this time the boarded the windows shut so i couldn't escape. bu there is one thing they never thought of. I learned all my fighting techniques from  dwight schrute, ron swanson, the furious 5 from kung fu panda, and shrek. the second time they came in to feed me i karate chopped their head off and ran out. i'm now in hiding but at least i got my account back."
"Ich bin echt super angepinkelt. The Walking Dead Staffel 9 nicht synchronisiert. üò±euer Ernst .Bin sauer"
"Jokoy my favorite stand up commedian on Netflix."
"While I like Netflix shows, I didn't have it after I moved but planned to sign up again at some point. I received 3 emails yesterday from Netflix, 1 saying thank you for signing up again (I didn't), 1 saying I changed my password (I didn't), and 1 saying I changed my email address (I didn't). I'm guessing someone hacked Netflix, changed my password and email address, took over my account and charged my card for service to them. If someone actually had my CC account # I doubt Netflix would be their first and only charge, and in Euro dollars. They seem uninterested when I tell them what happened, I stopped the debit card at my bank and am disputing the charge. And now because my email address is changed, I no longer have an account, and even if I want service I can't log in. I guess it's bye bye to Netflix."
"I'm an older person and I don't have too much time to watch any movies or TV programs.  That being said I don't think Netflix really caters to an older crowd cos I have seen that they produce way too many movies and TV shows for younger people, people who are in their teens and 20s mostly.  If they would produce more shows for older people ( people in their 40s and beyond )  would be much happier using their website.    I am very excited for "" El Camino "" but honestly when I login to Netflix I just find myself scrolling and scrolling for something to watch but I never find anything worthwhile.  Thank God I split the cost of my membership with my Brother or else I think I would have canceled it long ago."
"There are many video.Cant find all the shows and video quality is somewhat bad though."
"They cancel too many good shows, the are and will continue to LOSE shows, they keep raising their prices too often and their in-house content is sky diving. I have used NETFLIX for years and I think as soon as that competitor comes out in November, I'll kiss NF üëãüëã. YOU R BECOMING NOT WORTH IT"
"Movies dont come on time and prices going up. When i call customer service they dont even care. I told them i want to cancel my suscription and they dont even care to keep me being customer for 15 years. Horrible company.  I hope they loose against competitors."
"I have no Netflix account and yet am charged a fee every month! Asked the bank to cancel this but they can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not a direct debit/standing order. I can‚Äôt cancel through Netflix because I have no account to cancel it through! Reported debit card as lost and got a new one and STILL the money is being taken every month!!! They are basically stealing money out my account every month and I can‚Äôt find a way to stop it."
"Hello I have been  using Netflix for a long time and I love everything thing about it but I‚Äôm extra sad that skylanders  Academy  I no longer going to have another season because my kid loves that show and now mummy kid is extremely sad and has been crying but I‚Äôm trying to find a show like it but I am not that  successful right now. I do love netflix but I really need a new season of skylanders  Academy."
"Best site out there for watching films and series."
"We are not happy with Netflix at all, you can't watch any movie without hassle, every 5 minutes stop then you have to wait and restart again.i dont recommend"
"I had Netflix for about 1 year, paid for. I got a bit bored of seeing the same things advertised and felt I‚Äôd exhausted the service, so decided to quite it for a while. A few months later I get an email saying I‚Äôm entitled to ‚Äúanother free trial‚Äù, a while late I decide il give it another go, clicking to activate before the date it expires, and it wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge my free trial. I open up the help live chat on their website, to be told I need to read the small print and I‚Äôm not actually entitled to a free trial as I‚Äôve already had one in the beginning, around 18 months prior. I ask why I‚Äôve received two emails in the last few weeks to say I‚Äôm entitled to ‚ÄúANOTHER free trial‚Äù to which I‚Äôm not answered with anything other than ‚Äúyou need to read the small print‚Äù the small print of which states you can‚Äôt have another free trial if you‚Äôve had one, deeming the entire email offering ANOTHER free trial, a complete farce! I called them to ask them to remove all of my card details and delete me completely from the system as I wish to never use their service again. Customer service was appalling on both communications. Dealt with by people who did not give a care in the world whether I was a happy customer or otherwise. Didn‚Äôt try to keep my custom. I will not use the boring, repetitive, misleading and uncaring Service ever again... roll on the release of Apple TV+ !!! I hope Netflix really suffers from the release of better options."
"Outstanding website.Amazing customer service.Great value.Well done Netflix."
"first class documentarys"
"Rang them to tonight , could not get on my account , tried everything , no joy . Then I read my emails , they had suspended my account because someone had logged in from Croatia,  I'm in UK. I was expecting to be on hold for ages , they answered the phone instantly , and within two minutes my account was up and running again . I have to say , virgin and sky need to take a leaf out of Netflix customer service care , second to none.  Well done and thank you Netflix,  my sons were ripping their hair out for a few minutes ."
"Got through nearly instantly when I called and my issue was solved with minutes. The woman on the phone was lovely and put my mind at ease as my account had been hacked."
"Sacred game 2 is amazing series who love to watch the crime drama series."
"WHY THE HELL DID YOU CANCEL THE RED ROAD!!!! I WILL NOT GET SUCKED INTO A GREAT SERIES THEY DECIDED TO CANCEL LEAVING ME WITHOUT A CONCLUSION! SO PISSSED OFF RIGHT NOW!!!!"
"My account was hacked. Customer service were very helpful! Patient & understanding. Overall, great!"
"Netflix UK is getting really bad. Price increase and the choice of films is pathetic... not worth the money anymore, theirs just nothing decent to watch... I travel to Ukraine a lot to see my wife and the choices are far better than UK, UK... very rarely refresh the films and what the hell is this all about with films with subtitles, cancelled mine now..."
"Yall really need to work on your customer service skills. Its sucks!!! 1st of all I call them to figure out wht Netflix has been raising prices on a monthly basis then they're not willing to pay you back the difference. Netflix you all are thieves!! Canceled my service. Not stealing from me anymore I can tell you that you b***hes you!!!! Good riddins"
"Prices have gone up massively. I was forced into paying the extra on the tv app, now I have to wait a month to go back to the basic package. They‚Äôre conmen who will disappear soon if they carry on treating customers like this!"
"I set up Netflix in 2015.. 4 years ago.. content is average at best but that is irrelevant in this case. I set up my payments via PayPal, then changed the method after the free trial (which, by the way, they charged me for!!) to card payment. They have continued to take payment from both methods, PayPal on the 5th of the month and card payment on the 25th of the month. Refusing to refund ANY money even though they‚Äôve effectively stolen from me as I definitely did not authorise 2 payments for the same account - why would I? I offer to show them proof of payment for every single transaction but they are not interested. The lady I spoke to referred me back to PayPal, it‚Äôs not their problem and claim she ‚Äòcan‚Äôt see‚Äô any of what I‚Äôm describing on their system. This fraudulent behaviour is enough for me, my partner and all of my friends to cancel our subscriptions. Don‚Äôt bother with Netflix, it‚Äôs disgraceful."
"I'm paying for the service but netflix login tells me my account isn't active. Customer support claims I'm paying for another email address but I've never used any other and they won't tell me which. Then they get arrogant and rude when they can't help me, their system is flawed and I keep paying for a service that isn't delivered. I'll never use Netflix again."
"Followed the suggested complaint procedure. Complete silence from them regarding multiple charges they have taken. Complete disregard for customers. No wonder their share price has plummeted"
"very good series with high quality just remembering when when I pause the movie or the series and check if I was still watching that some cool feature in just 12dollar/Month me and all my friends I pay 3 dollar/month, I think is very very very cheap for all the movies and series I just hope can have more educations movies and series as well recommend and I watch all that in 4K just ask yourself how much you can rent a movie for just one week thank you Netflix"
"Some good movies. Better series. But the quality is very low. Also if you have the payed version and settings on Highest. Black scienes are grainy, fog is most of the time blocks and detail is hard to see. So mutch compression is on every thing. HD of 4K is more like 720 or lower. Befor i watched movies on Blueray minimum of 40 gig. Is I downloaded a 8 gig movie you could see a big diference. Movies on Netflix are like 4 gig or less if i compair the quality. To shame that you have to pay for this quality."
"Every time I clicked on Netflix to watch a movie I would search for thirty minutes to an hour which would usually make me very sleepy. I would many times, then go to bed without watching anything, because the only things I could find were either complete garbage or left leaning trash that Netflix would have to pay me to watch.Horrible, horrible programming full of the dirtiest most foul and offensive garbage imaginable. Truly trash that only a perverted liberal would like. Good riddance to filth."
"Customer service is so bad...Maybe try and hire some non indians to sit in the customer serice center.I chatted with two different ""people"" (Or bots for that matter) because when i try to verify my phone number i never get the code. Tried with two different phone numbers to no avail.The first guy ended the conversation with, and i Quote: Kavin NetflixOKay , Reason: Advise customer to add phone number and complete sms verificationKavin NetflixYou need to contact your bank for the further clarification about your bank transfer .So i need to contact my bank because your verification system doesn't work? How odd...The next guy told me to clear with my telecom provider that they don't block sms messages AND calls from them to me. How funny that i have tried with two different phones with two completly different providers. Still no code.Netflix should be ashamed..."
"Can‚Äôt fault it. Great range of stuff to watch"
"For 2-3 months there has been a bug on Netflix that Netflix 'will fix soon' and they still haven't. I get Netflix Error M7353-5101, go through all the troubleshooting steps, tried different browser etc and nothing fixes it. I was frustrated and contacted customer support and spoke to a manager, Kiran, was unsympathetic and unhelpful with the situation.They said 'it will be fixed soon' as always and offered no compensation for the frustration it has caused. In fact Kiran just simply said 'I suggest you watch another title'. What terrible customer support."
"Some of the tv series are good Star Trek lost in space etc but they. Tend to cancel some good series very frustrating the films they have are ok but tend to be to old and a lot of b movies very poor compared to the American version"
"Complete trash and waste of time. All foreign or low budget movies that nobody would ever watch. Only a few have ever seen a movie theatre. You could search for a thousand movies and i can guarantee you for a fact you wont find a single one. Netflix series is even a bigger joke. Be prepared to be more disappointed than you have ever been. How they continue to get subscribers is unknown. They should be investigated by the fbi for fraud on a billion dollar scale"
"Really poor connection, even with 4g internet speed. I have been a paying customer for since Netflix came out, it has always buffered and still to this day has poor connection, it loads to 99% and just stops, really expected much more from netflix."
"I‚Äôm getting Pretty fed up of Netflix. I am so sick of getting really in to a series to find out that it‚Äôs been cancelled by Netflix . I‚Äôve jst finished season 3 of travellers which was amazing to find out they have cancelled it. This is about the 4/5 series I‚Äôve got in to for them to cancel it. What is the point of watching anymore just to be left disappointed . Might as well cancel it"
"Surprised that Netflix has such a low rating! Not only that have an amazing range of movies and series available, they also create fantastic originals, plus it is a super affordable service!"
"Never had any issues. Great TV and good customer service so far"
"After the recent price hike we left Netflix it's just not worth it now , hardy any decent shows on it , they're taking more shows off than adding more"
"I just wanted to make a payment they had to make things complicated by we goining through ITunes. Since they don't want my money than well their fault don't subscribe it waste of money"
"My account was hacked (I hadn‚Äôt even subscribed for a year), and payment taken. I couldn‚Äôt believe the Netflix customer services, I spoke to two people who pretty much said it wasn‚Äôt their problem. They did refund me and close down the account, but took no responsibility for the data breach. I‚Äôve had a bit of a search on line, and realise that there is actually no way to complain about them. Just another huge organisation refusing to use any of the millions of pounds profit they make to take responsibility for your data."
"Awesome, life is better now Netflix exists!"
"Appauling content choice. This is 2019 not 1960! Stop putting the prices up with no good new content!"
"Extremely limited film selection.Too many foreign-language films, ultra-violent movies (containing graphic murders, sexual violence and shootings) and dated series. I only paid for it because I thought it would be better than Youtube. Better to stick with the free series. I mainly use it while I am working, so am unable to watch these foreign subtitled films (subtitles are often inaccurate anyway judging by the terrible English ones).Film selection rarely changes and often recommends movies I've already watched, rated down or downright didn't like.Save your money - watch Youtube, Vimeo, Popcorn flix or literally anything else instead. If you are thinking of paying for these films - IT ISN'T WORTH IT!!!"
"For the sake of all that's pure please change up your content inventory every once in a while."
"Love the service good choice of entertainment very affordable can cancel when I like yes great wee service keep it up."
"This Larry zazeela and Larry zazeela just mailed a  payment  in order to keep watching Netflix and asked for a refund check because Larry zazeela needs that other money back"
"I watch the sacred game in the netflix. It is too awesome. üëå i recommend people to watch it."
"I am being driven nuts by repeated failures when trying to watch movies, with ""Whoops, something went wrong...""  This happens when I stream or after I have downloaded it.  I then try and download again, and Netflix rubs salt in the wound by blocking the download, saying I have reached my download quota for the year.  Thanks guys.I suspect they outsource their software to some cheapo sweatshop.  Sure it saves them some money, but sure doesn't do much for customer satisfaction.I would recommend another provider.  I am already looking."
"I have been using Netflix for over a year and have enjoyed the content - both movies and television shows immensely. Unfortunately, I was kicked out from my account by a hacker who changed my email address. I immediately rang the helpdesk and was in a right state, panicking that the hacker now had access to my banking details. Unfortunately, they said that I could be the hacker and acted in a confrontational manner when I asked how could I be in Egypt when I was just watching a show in the UK when I was kicked out. They blamed me for not setting up a mobile double-step and so they said the only thing I could do was either close the account or give them my card details.  I was absolutely paranoid by this point so I asked them to close it immediately. Did they do that or just leave it for the hacker? Who knows. I will never use a streaming service again. I've been paranoid ever since  and wanted to warn other customers that it can happen to them too. They did try and reassure me that my banking details were safe, but who can be sure?"
"Over the last few months they have still taken our money without providing a consistent service. No explanation or apologies. Such a shame. Word of mouth is such a powerful thing."
"Just put my subscription price up by 20%. Totally unacceptable and frankly outrageous. Choice of programmes is ok but not great. Prices extortionate so I'm leaving. Tried to e mail them about my complaints but they make it impossible, another sign of a company that doesn't care about customer service. I'd avoid, there's better out there."
"Netflix used to have great Customer Service. When I called with an issue recently, I wasn't prepared to feel that my issue is unimportant and my concerns are dismissed. Customer service supervisor Manuel (or Miguel) appeared uncaring, pushy and dismissive of any concerns/ suggestions with a couple of talking points as a response to anything"
"I have cancelled my account due to moving countries and today they have taken a payment. I called about it just to find out that i had another account. I have queried this a few years back as I wasn‚Äôt happy with two payments coming out of my bank account, just to be told that this is normal. Today I found out it isn‚Äôt normal and shouldn‚Äôt been told that. So i made a complaint because i was paying for nothing for years, and all i got as a response that they do not have calls recorded for that far back and they can only refund 3 months charges. They wouldn‚Äôt even investigate the complaint, and the manager refused to take the call (I wasn‚Äôt cursing nor raising my voice). Customer service is horrible, i will never have a Netflix account again."
"I might have to cancel if they keep putting the price up for my subscription!"
"Don't cancel series that is very good. I think you will be loosing much more viewers by canceling series. Bring back Santa Clarita Diet bring back one day at a time."
"the service is getting worse lots of buffering and very poor picture quality"
"I have never used Netflix and I was on the phone for 1hr and 35 min to try to set up my free 30day  trial and after all that time being on the phone pretty much called a liar and said my phone was used for it before which it never was management didn‚Äôt do anything it was a big waste of time so as far as I‚Äôm concerned Netflix is fraudulent they do not honor their 30 day free trial  and I will never use Netflix their customer service is terrible they do not treat their customers proper at all so my recommendations go to Hulu and prime from what I understand they barely add new crap anyway so they can suck it and I will plaster bad reviews all over the place And call the Better Business Bureau"
"As much as anyone may love and use Netflix, their security is horrendous. I have seen countless cases where people have had fraudulent payment be made to them but they ""can't"" do anything about it.My mum had an email regarding a suspicious login, but they let said login immediately change the email address and password on the account. Netflix literally ""can't"" do anything about it because they ""can't"" trace across old details against accounts, nor find an account based on the payment details. Their solution is literally just create a new account because your old one is gone now. The Netflix security is unacceptable, and I can't recommend anyone use it until they add 2 step authentication, like every other major service does. And considering they are a high target for using stolen bank details, they should probably step up to help their customers crack down on this."
"Netflix is a good addition to the other streaming services I already have.I however doubt if it can be enough for me on its own."
"Their customer service is great! They have a live chat now and it‚Äôs actually a real person talking with you which makes things 100% easier. One of the things they really need to add is being able to search shows and movies by year. Another great feature to add is more descriptive genres, for example, psychological horrors/thrillers. Over all Netflix is a steal to have even though some times they don‚Äôt seem to update and there is a dry period. But it is worth the $10-$17 compared to cable contracts or buying movies individuallly."
"My big gripe with Netflix is the home page. 1) Films/series I have watched from the beginning to the end remain on my home page. 2) Films/series I have abandoned because I didn't like them stay glued to my home page. 3) If I dare give the thumbs down for a particular film/series, Netflix assumes I mean the genre instead of the particular film/series in question.4) There is no way to remove recommendations from my home page. Results: Tons of ""recommendations"" on my home page that I've already watched, I've abandoned or are of no interest to me at all. A mess.Netflix's algorithm based system of recommendations really needs a radical rethink."
"Was getting charged by netflix 2 and 3 times a month! Apparently multiple accounts were set up and i was being charged for them. 18 overpayments!! Their extremely rude customer service then refused to refund me all but 6 of the charges and repeatedly told me it was my fault. I asked them to delete my card details and block the account. A few weeks later i get more charges, even though i had deleted my own card details and was using paypal instead. Turns out they never took any actions and i was still being charged by a fake account. Absolute joke! They are getting hacked repeatedly and then telling customers that they can get their money back from the bank instead of them."
"Netflix provided tones of series for consumers to kill their time. Netflix do have lots of choices for different kind of people, specifically for any members in a family."
"Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãa company that I like to give my money and every company can take an example! Recently I had a problem with my payment on PayPal and I asked for help! The customer service was very friendly and told me to check if PayPal automatically disabled my membership, which actually was the case! It took 2 minutes to solve the problem and the woman I spoke to even apologized for the inconvenience, even though it was not even her fault! Apart from that, Netflix also offers new movies and series of every genre, so everyone can enjoy new content every month! You won a loyal subscriber!"
"for the price wonderful service, never had an issue so cant speak to their customer service"
"I found out today that I have been charged for services that canceled in my 30 day free trial.  I was charged a total of $156.23, but they were only willing to credit $47.  Was told that they would do nothing more. I spoke with supervisor, Maria, employee # 3005142 (that's what she said),  When I didn't agree with her, she said she was giving me a warning.  I laughed, then said a warning for what, not agreeing?  She said yes.  She then gave me another warning.  Keep in mind, I'm not cussing or raising my voice.  Just disagreeing.  When I voiced that to her, she hung up.  Now I'm mad."
"chris rock in tamborine it should be banned and netflix fined, i love netflix but how can they allow the release of this stand up when hes saying he wants more white kids shot dead thats not comedy,i dont mind racism in comedy but this is hate netflix should be disgusted.If anyone has not watched this on netflix try it you will be leaving a review about netflix just for that standup comedy (chris rock tamborine).Netflix allowed this be released on the same day seventeen people were shot dead in Florida. Fourteen of the kids were white.remove it netflix.If that was white comedian his career would be over and he would hung by the public if he said he wants more black kids shot dead and there mums crying for them,what the hell NETFLIX"
"No issues with the streaming service but horrible customer service!My account was hacked and they were not able to offer any support. I was treated very antagonistically on 2 occasions. I was never given an apology for what happened and was told basically there is nothing we can do - if you aren't happy then cancel your service."
"Really loves Sacred Games, Excited for Season 2. Will Watch tomorrow ;)"
"Netflix has become more politically divisive by the day, it‚Äôs a shame really‚Ä¶ they used to have good quality shows. Now they cater mostly to fringe groups."
"Keep doing what you're doing. Please remember we're human too."
"I had a sign-in that clearly wasn't me, so I changed my password. Except not even five minutes later, Netflix sent me an email that the ""email on file"" was changed too; except it wasn't changed to any of my emails whatsoever and I couldn't access the account. I called Netflix and tried to regain access to it, except that they told me the card number I gave ""wasn't the card on file"", except that it was, and there was no other way to verify my account even with my old email, name, all my old passwords etc. So I asked the guy to cancel the entire old account so I could just make a new one. He SAYS he did. Except today, literally the day after he ""canceled it"" there were FIVE attempted charges by Netflix to the card.I refuted the charges and canceled the new and old account, but still waiting for them to try and charge me again so I can refute those. I'm taking my business entirely to Hulu. The better customer service is worth the commercials."
"Best Free Movie Finder has better movies and is totally free. Sorry Netflix, but I'm giving you 5 stars only because I hate to be negative towards other people's work. Get better movies! Google ""Best free movie finder"" and see for yourselves."
"If you're happy to watch any old rubbish, Netflix is great for you.  I'm talking the series that gets 5-6 /10 on IMDB.  If you want better, the series' are few and far between.  Better to pay for a couple of months and dip out.  Do the same with Now TV and pick up the new HBO series and you'll save a packet and get better TV!"
"My account got hacked twice in a month..no security at all. I cannt cancel subscription cuz all details changed, I cancelled card details..dont care anymore. Will never use again."
"They are drawing money from your account without consent, letting you believe it‚Äôs a free month trial. I really don‚Äôt understand how there‚Äôs no institution sanctioning them yet."
"The Majority of Stuff, is so poor, bad acting, terrible directors. Amazon prime I'd far superior tv. Some of the popular, trending TV is absolutely boring. Waste of money. Poor value."
"Fine , worth of money. But we missed telugu movies."
"Their customer service is awful! My account was hacked as a result they suspended it to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù my financial information. Ironically they kept giving out conflicting information and what they call ‚Äúorientation‚Äù that did not make any sense. When asked about compensation for the time I need to invest to rest my bank, email, mortgage accounts they said we were able to restore your account! Is this is a joke?! #Netflix this is the lowest of the lowest I have ever seen. Oh and Kelly the supervisor thinks she owns the company ... #netflixsucks!"
"Great value for money - movies AND entertainment. In 2 years I've only had 1 glitch with anything I've watched. A film randomly stopped half way through and refused to play again until he day after. Then it were fine again.The only downfall with Netflix is the fact it's rather hard to find new material... be a big easier it there was a genre section with a scroll down page of movie/series in same order so you know what you've watched easier and what you haven't. The lack of a star is due to there being FAR TOO MANY foreign films ..mainly in the horror section (which scrolls across the page) with no warnings it's got subtitles."
"Netflix is great. Great choice of movies new and old. Specifically like the comedies section and documentaries are bringing to the table. Sometimes find the app crashes or has no connection on my LG tv. Otherwise, some great films being produced by Netflix for Netflix."
"are you kidding me? In all the films add gay, black, lesbian and all this is controlled by feminists? everything was fine until you loose the witcher. the best game and a series of books were spoiled by actors who are not suitable for the role of tris and yenifer, they also spoiled the whole series of books with their tolerance. and all because everything is ruled by a feminist who spoils everything. You will lose this best episode and miss up further impression about the Witcher."
"Today : no access to the last season i was watching yesterday No answer excepts : we experience technical issues : wait.I could have wait but Netflix chose to raise the prices to offer a worse serviceI will  go to dl on torrents and get another paying service. Do not raise the price when you cannot provide basic access or, at least, commercial gestures when service is down."
"My Netflix would not play any films, instead it came up with an error message. This was at the same time that my account payment was due.I contacted Netflix on there premium rate number, and I was told to unplug my TV for 3 minutes, after doing this the same error message came up. I was told to contact my TV provider for a software up. After doing this it was found that the software was all up to date.I therefore asked for a refund and cancelled my contract.I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THAT IT TAKES 30 WORKING DAYS FOR THEM TO REFUND MY MONEY,CON ARTISTS"
"They have amazing shows and things that are fun but why oh why do they take shows off of there while your watching then"
"Netflix, make sure you sign up on the 1st, because I signed up on the 28th, and they tried to run my card on the 28th, but I don't get paid until 1 day before the 1st. So they didnt even give me 30 days, because that would have been the 31st that they should have charged me."
"When I first got Netflix I thought it was great - so much to watch. But I soon discovered their annoying habit of removing films, only to add them again down the line, as a 'new release', which they are not.  They do this over and over again. There is very little actual new material added, so once you have watched the films you like, there is little else to watch.  If you like watching American series's then Netflix is probably for you as you will find plenty on there."
"Just find out, netflix started to translate movies to Russian language, really appreciate it."
"Charged for the So called Free Trial. Paid the amount but its miss selling.Standard agencies are now aware"
"Absolute rubbish. Got a new tv tried activating netflux.  Activation code did not work.  They dont even have the manners to respond to my paypal dispute.  I want my money back because it does not work. Ignorant.  Not worth doing business with them."
"STOP TAKING POPULAR SHOWS OFF! I‚Äôm almost done paying to watch a show half way then try and rush to get it done."
"Been wondering why I havent been able to sign into my Netflix recently so went on my app ony phone and checked the history and foun out some random person from Nigeria had somehow got onto it... Ofc I called up Netflix and the guy I spoke to was so helpful bless him, couldnt have wished for better service and made sure that everyone got signed out correctly. Now it‚Äôs back to normal. Please everyone make sure you check your history on things that seem odd as I didn‚Äôt really expect this myself. If you ever need any help they are very helpful, I work in a call centre myself so know it can be draining but he kept his chill all the way through and we had some good banter along the way too :)"
"This is  one.For the,Easy  pleased ..Brigade .3 Maybe 4 films worth watching .By the time you look for something to watch  its  time  4   bed  .lol"
"I wish it was a bit more cheaper. Good content though."
"For someone working within the Film industry it is great to see much new content being made daily. What is also great is seeing how the classics are still being watched. There is so many films and TV shows to see."
"I Absolutely love the production value of Netflix Originals, but the thing that I don't understand is why aren't all Netflix Originals available on Netflix? What is the point of paying ¬£12 per month to get a small part of Netflix Originals and some of your favourite shows and films removed.. If people are Paying for Netflix, they should at least be able to access all productions made by Netflix."
"Worst thing ever. Avoid!!!"
"I have been happy with netflix for year as there is something to watch all the time also the app is perfect and the price is amazing aswell."
"I signed up for a free trial. After 9 days I realised that my paypal account had been charged 18.49. I advised netflix of the issue to which they responded that it was too late to reverse the charge. I asked to speak to someone who could reverse the charge and they advised that they were following a system and everyone else would follow the same system. They tried to tell me that it was ok as I could continue to use the service for the next 20 days. I continued to express my concern. Nothing was done to rectify the situation despite many attempts. I would never recommend netflix and will never use again."
"Even though I am paying more money they supposed to be putting me stuff to watch but it‚Äôs utter rubbish they don‚Äôt put any new movies or episodes of anything just the same crap"
"I signed up for Netflix with the free trial. They charged my card the next day saying one of the devices used had a Netflix account previously. Yes, it was my son who paid for it himself, not me, so now I can't get the free trial. The only option they gave me was to cancel my subscription."
"Netlix will cheat you again and again. Never go netflix. Its a fraud company, once you have entered the card details, they will make sure that billing never stop. Even if you have cancelled your subscription.Never think of trying netflix. They will suck all your money."

"¬£2 price rise per month is disgusting and uncalled for, from ¬£9.99 to ¬£11.99, Pure Greed on Netflix behalf. Exploitation of the average family. Hang your heads in shame"
"I have a son with down syndrom who likes his independence.  However, he also likes to delete everyone elses profiles.  It seems that netflix can not get into the modern age and create accounts that would allow for the primary profile to be password protected and the admin would then create and delete profiles not everyone who watches TV.  I have complained and they do not seem to care, understand nor want to do anything about this.  I am constantly having to listen to my daughter and myself complain because our profiles have been deleted.  Also,  I am constantly having to sign out and resign in when the netflix circle just spins or we get a black screen."
"Multiple glitches always preventing netflix from working and you spend countless hours trying to repair. Customer service has no idea and no authority for refund or realistic discounts. Sending you to the tech guys leads to more hours of wasted time as they have no idea what there doing and have yet to fix a single glitch. Stay away from netflix, their movie/tv categories suck anyway"
"Ok I am here to make your life easier. DO NOT GET NETFLIX EVER. First of all I have spent tHE wHoLE wEeK planning to watch Me before you on Netflix as soon as I finished the book - and of course I double checked today before I watched it to see that it was still there just to find tonight it WAS GONE. I am sick and tired of paying good MONEY for this terrible service to let me down again and again and AGAIN. I was very much looking forward to a chill night watching a good romance for it not to be there. I am appalled."
"As a long standing Netflix fan, I love the ground breaking series they have produced, and no more waiting a week for new episodes, although my sleep pattern does not thank me for this :)My only disappointment at times is when series and shows are removed from the service :( but that's life.Quality viewing!"
"I am ready to cancel netflix, I am fed up of the previews, i want to scroll through yet every few seconds it plays a preview who cam up with preview? They need to be sacked."
"For mange d√•rlige B-Film"
"Lately their streaming has been so poor!!!! Trust me it‚Äôs not my internet, it is Netflix technology and it is failing more and more everyday!"
"When they originally started, Netflix was an innovative service.  Their subsequent degression in terms of service went from innovative, to exemplary, ok, to mediocre, to frankly useless.  Their streaming portfolio is fairly rubbish in comparison to Amazon Video.  Their DVD / BD service is complete and utter garbage.  I currently am subscribed to the 2 BD out at a time.  I typically watch the movie the day it arrives and return it the following day.  Or at least that was the plan.  In the last 2 months I've received 9 disks total.  Only 4 of which were playable."
"PURE GARBAGE SELECTION!Still better than HBO though, so i can't complain too much. It doesn't help when they block every single VPN i have tried. Such scum.The series is great though, as well as the films they have. I just wish they cared more about other countries than the US."
"I had problems with downloaded files not playing and contacted customer services to be told that errors are inevitable and that they would do nothing to address the problem - I just had to accept it.  The worst customer service response I think I have ever experienced - their attitude was truly staggering.  Avoid..."
"great content, flawless streaming with 4k ultra, had no problems, I like"
"Bad costumer services, they don‚Äôt respect the costumers, I Pay my money and when I need help they just laughs"
"Your paying all this money for crap Netflix is a dam joke half the time it don‚Äôt work and the other half of the time there is nothing to watch they take off all the good shows and replace them with garbage"
"Just new in NETFLIX, before I was just dreaming having Netflix subscription I find it expensive just to watch a show we'll you can eventually watch it soon when somebody uploaded it.. But, when I found out that there are so many shows,movies,series that I could watch unlimitedly I had to subscribe.. Then I was so amazed of how huge the selection Netfilx have, my thinking of how expensive it is just to watch erased.. Now I watch Netflix almost everyday,every time I had a free time, because I get to entertain by the shows, movies and also learn the history of different places because they have it here.. all in all its satisfying and worth paying for me.."
"DONT CARE ATTITUDE!!!!Disgusting company to deal with.  Bought gift vouchers for a present.  When they didn't work the website told me to contact Netflix so I did.  3 calls a d 3 hours later I have been told that the vouchers dont work and they dont care and they do not know how to fix it.   What am I meant to do???  ROBBERS AND CLUELESS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT."
"mixed opinion, been using for many yrs and for me its getting worse re monthly content. i get they are trying fo appeal to as broader range as poss and i like the euro dub series like dark, black spot..... but on the flip im getting frustrated with their lack of commitment re cancelling shows purely on how much money vs viewer stats usually in the first week of the season airing. at least give it a chance.we dont pay for each tv show so to me this stat based bias is killing great shows which from reading customer reviews are still attracting subscribers. the number of good shows each month for me is getting less. im seriously considering other services. used to watch it everyday now its rare i can find anything watchable. shame."
"Doesn't work with a VPN. This on it's own is fair enough, maybe they have valid reasons for this, though it certainly is annoying when you want you want to use public WiFi. However the bit that seems wrong to me is that it's only the watching of videos which doesn't work when you are using a VPN - signing up and giving your credit card details away works perfectly! Furthermore, there are no helpful error messages telling you why you can't watch videos, it just doesn't work.Also Netflix says it has 3 seasons of Gavin and Stacey, but the 3rd season is in fact just the Christmas special between the 2nd and 3rd seasons, and in reality there are no episodes from the 3rd season."
"This is a serious rip off. Avoid being a member at all costs. I just restarted my membership and it doesn't validate my password. I changed it several times but it still gives me issues. This is the same reason I cancelled my membership before. It also deleted all my downloads,imagine how much data I wasted. When I called the help center it just plays music for over 5min. They debited R139 and I have no access to their service. DO NOT BECOME A MEMBER...Nev"
"NetFlix has a wide variety of movies and shows, the picture quality is good enough.."
"Always crashes. Doesnt show titles. I will be canceling my subscription!"
"Super service. I find many movies like Japanese love story and horrors plus comedy. The most I love Netflix for anime that's great because I love action and story line."
"Why does netflix make 1 season of these programs then cancel it everytime. Its ridiculous"
"Something lacking - many movies are subtitled - most seem to be from USA with very similar story lines (I sometime think that in the making of a movie the film sufficient to make 2)- story lines seem old - full of Zombies attributes , corny aliens, virus infects wiping out society- I spend hours to find something that attracts me - wish I could be more positive."
"Man for the amount we pay a month... you would think there would be better movies and shows! Half of them aren‚Äôt even in English. A few shows we have tried to watch and it‚Äôs all subtitles. Majority of the movies are old movies that have already been on Netflix years ago. Seriously thinking of cancelling my subscription."
"Netflix is becoming unwatchable because of dated and subtitled films, I very rarely manage to finish watching a film, and now they insult subscribers by putting up the fees, I now think the time has come to find another provider."
"Ask for a dollar on a free trial membership then say theyll reimburse it but i never got it back movies suck guess thats wat service u get when u become wealthy bunch of rats"
"So outdated.. films are from 1970s. Don't waste your money...complete rubbish"
"Good all round TV and FIlms to choose from very happy with this. Big problem is when watching a Film on TV it stops working and you can not play again. I rang them up, and they said nothing they can do about it, even when there was a error message showing.A big let down for a large company like this, it only works on my ipad or smart phone, they need to get this sorted."
"Honestly depends who you are talking to. Some people are great and others are extremely rude. I was confused as to why Netflix when they kept sending me offers for another free month when the offer didn't work I enquired and the person I was talking to couldn't explain why. They were very cocky and rude with their answers and I just ended the chat in frustration."
"I signed up today 6/25/19 and it says "" having trouble "" try different connection."
"I have been a Netflix customer for years. I recently lost my credit card and was unaware that the bill was due to be paid. My payment must have been due during the time it took to be replaced.I WAS CUT OFF FROM THE SERVICE. No communication from the company asking if there was a problem just CUT ME OFF. Well I've changed my provider so good riddance to your rude condescending arrogant customer service team.I appreciate not all advisors are of this poor quality but they are really tarring you all with the same brush!!!!!!"
"Good movie subscription service, but sad that in Indonesia not all movies and tv shows are available because of licensing, not like Amazon Prime."
"honestly i love netflix and it has become an important part of my daily routine i dont know if i can live without it anymore"
"If i could have given no stars........... Simply too expensive, their monthly content is exceedingly poor as they appear to be using our hard earned subs into so called specialist tv content which is few and far between. Netflix has ""jumped the shark"" go elsewhere far better smaller, cheaper streaming services with excellent content"
"Great and honest service overall.Very good value for money comparing with all similar services, at least the ones available in Ireland. High quality, lots of new content and subtitles for everything. Customer for 7 years now and will continue for the years to come."
"netflix it a very poor film platforms , i can not trust them of credit card information and personal information as it's unsecure and it was hacked lot of times ,there are  lot of video tutorial on youtube about how get free membership on netflix , also they get user access for user that have already paid the subscription this mean that haccker can easy get your credit card infos on netflix .."
"absolutely atrocious customer service, actually got sniggered at by the person handling my call. I have never dealt with such a rude customer service team ever. constantly speak over you and in a patronising tone. its a shame I cant give minus stars or I would. little Mr Red GI Joe needs a reality check - he's a customer service assistant for a reason."
"Great, I really into it"
"I have had Netflix for many years and the last few I have seen a decline in shows I am interested in, but still kept the service. That is until I had to report my credit card as lost, yes it was my fault. But the very next day my bill was due. They offered no grace period, they just shut it down. I also had my cell phone bill and my internet service come due and they gave me a short but much appreciated grace period. It has been a week and I must say I do not miss Netflix. I realize they really don't have much to offer, even at only $9 a month, it is not worth it. I did not expect them to offer me unlimited time to pay my bill, just a few days grace period and I probably wouldn't have cancelled. But in the end they did me a favor, and lost a customer.They aren't horrible, but they aren't all that anymore either."
"Disgusting such a waste of pimento even speak to them"
"This is a pretty good company. Why not."
"I have had Netflix for years and not a problem. But I will be cancelling and joining amazon this month. The films are low quality rating films also these recent months the box sets and films are foreign and subtitles. They put on the odd recent (18 month ago) released film. And seem to rota all the poor production failed ones. Its like going to bargain 50p/¬£1.00 corner of an old dvd shop."
"Great product, terrible customer service both online and over the phone. No UK based address for customer services so following up by post requires writing to Netherlands. Customer services have clearly been briefed not to refund customers, which is appalling having been overcharged in a technical error on Netflix's part. I had to make contact with customer services four times after the customer service representative who I spoke to first realised that she had failed to put me on hold whilst speaking to her boss, so just hung up on me. The worst customer service I've ever received from a company."
"Best available choice out there. Not great, not terrible ;)  My only wish that somebody will stop streaming services monopoly, and they remain streaming services, not content services. I wish I can watch Chernobyl for example, not only at 3 Letters , but on Netflix too, or other services. Or Handmaid's Tale available only you know where.. Please, end this monopoly! Somebody!  I don't want 15 subs, I will not pay for a 15 subs, I would just torrent..."
"I love the designated survivor series, always has and the new season is great too. But why oh why has it suddenly required so many profanities in its dialogue. The language is shocking. Clean it up before season 4"
"I am disappointed that Netflix feels that the more profanity it can include in a 45 minute program, the better. Recently, Netflix purchased the rights to continue the former NBC program ‚ÄúDesignated Survivor‚Äù. It was a program I enjoyed, but when I watched the first episode of Netflix‚Äôs season 3 I heard the F word 3 times in the first 20 minutes!  The President‚Äôs young daughter was also cursing and when her dad told her how disappointed her mother would be, she responded, in effect, ‚ÄúSo, what?‚Äù I also find it concerting that Netflix removed the ability for viewers to leave reviews for its programs and movies on the actual Netflix site. That tells me they were getting negative feedback from viewers that they did not want other viewers to see. I have always appreciated the ability for viewers to tell their opinion of media as a way to warn others of poor quality or inappropriate content. When media outlets start to censor the feedback, that is when we all should be worried."
"Netflix cls produced shows are pathetic. Take for example UNDERCOVER. The plot line is absurd. The dialogue is pathetic. Some of the actors are awful.Netflix will never survive if they ever have any serious competition.What I can't understand is why their leadership team is so incompetent!Their performance is the same as an awful cook opening a restaurant. The food would suck as badly as Netflix's cls produced shows. Great job Netflix: you're MORONS!!!"
"Great Service. Great Choice of films and documentries"
"why such a big company has a bad support team? you know that its a big disappointment ?"
"Fat executive wants to support killing babies by NOT supporting the Georgia abortion law!! If that fat boy keeps talking, I will be canceling this overpriced lefty streaming service. Tell that fat boy to shut up!!"
"It is unacceptable, I'm discussed. After Maria doc most be removed! I'm a customer and I thought that Netflix main GOAL is to provide an absolute program Non Objective. And capable to distinguish good from bad!"
"The best video on demand experience out there. I've used HBOgo for a while, but the quality comes nothing close to the one from Netflix. Now that Game of Thrones is over, I don't ever see myself watching hbogo anyway. Netflix has a more extensive library of movies and tv series too! Their customer service is also pretty good"
"Easy to join, all on line. Good variety of price packages. And I enjoy binge watching lots of really good programs. Some interesting documentary‚Äôs Love the food programsAnd big fan of drama Lots of variety to suit all tastes and the grandsons love the kids channel"
"Can't complain too much considering the good price! Good original content."
"My stepson is a big fan of Netflix so we decided to install it on our tv in the bedroom, sure Netflix has hundreds of movies to choose from,  especially if you're from India and you're a liberal bias. It's terrible, boring and nothing really new comes up,I hate it. Tv series once you finish watching the season series they leave you hanging there with no further updates."
"takes up every single bit of internet in your house, makes everything unusable"
"It's good so far, just continue to add more great movies and not so much on college romance! (not sure how they tailor this to my 'interest' as it's most definitely not)"
"Love it great choice"
"I signed up for a free trial and cancelled the same day. I want my money back. I cannot believe that people actually pay to watch this rubbish. I am a big fan of TV shows and seen the majority of them apart from the netflix originals. I think that I will binge watch prison break, as that is one TV show that I have never watched which might interest me. I went through sci-fi and nothing. I have tried amazon prime and that is far better and that is saying something. I am totally totally totally disappointed."
"Fantastic service. Amazing choice for a tenner a month is incredible !!"
"Nothing about Kaiser Wilhelm II and nothing good about it, they take out great movies, and replace them with movies nearly no one cares about"
"we got Netflix more than 5 years  what now boring coz, not a new movies same every day  we ¬£600 in 5ys   good by"
"Okay, I hate how Netflix takes off the most viewed movies and adds the least watched movies. Like, for example, they got rid of The Ghostbusters movie in March when it has been on Netflix since October. They also took my favorite movie off, The Breakfast Club and that has been on there for a while as well. I'm really mad about this, I'm also mad at their decision to jack up the prices for Netflix, now I can't even afford Netflix and other things. This is my only complaint about Netflix and hopefully they'll change somethings."
"I searched for a lot of movies and could not find any good movie.Only crap movies..no Tarantino movies,no Coel brothers movies..no good movies"
"Customer service awful not friendly. The price goes up without notification on email. They want me cancel in next month cycle ...Poor relationship with customer."
"Hacked accountJust had my deactivated account (deactivated for more than 6) hacked and experienced the worst customer service. It,s apparently not Netflix‚Äôs fault when your (deactivated) account gets hacked. As Netflix couldn‚Äôt get my still active credit card to work, I used my sisters to settle my account and closed it, which meant I had to wake her to verify my email and her credit card before they would help. They guy ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me asked if we‚Äôd like a refund for the amount wrongfully taken. OFF COURSE!  But they store you credit card information indefinitely in case you want to reopen your account. And in the mean time they‚Äôre not responsible, because they weren‚Äôt hacked - just my account. I don‚Äôt really think I want to reopen my account with that careless attitude to people‚Äôs sensitive information. Wonder if they heard of GDPR?"
"Customer service awful. App did not function on new Sony Bravia yet all other apps (bbc, you tube, now) all worked. Rip off and money stealers"
"Honestly I love Netflix, I am a series-junkie and they are making a lot of great series that I like. For example we have: Stranger Things, You, Sex Education, The order, The society and so on, but please Netflix calm down! You take a lot of time making a lot of new series and most of them goes really good but maybe focus on a smaller number of series so you can actually continue them! It is one season with 10 ep of all of it and I really got nothing to watch at now because all of them have their second seasons by like year 2020 or more? I understand you need to see if its worth making more seasons and it takes time and money but this cant be like GoT bc others and myself might be sick of waiting.. No but seriously, keep up the great work - you are amazing."
"Very dissapointed! I joined netflix as it offered (what i thought) a great deal at 5.99 per month for movies on one screen. I agreed to this deal and the very next day it sent an email thanking me for upgrading to the 7.99 deal (WHICH I DIDNT DO!!!) I went in to my emails to see how to downgrade it back to 5.99 deal and it was such a nightmare yet said it was simple! For months on end i thought it was still on 5.99 deal and discovered for months its been taking 9.99 without my permission!! The team wont help with this and said they see at their end that i upgraded and they won't refund. I know very well that i didn't upgrade so I've closed the whole account! Good by Netflix! Not as impressive as i thought when i first seen! #CaringForKian"
"I was in the middle of a episode of Hawaii 5-0 and it just stopped. I was so mad, I I love you that show. I will not pay for a account if that show is not back on in 2 months. Please, put it back on so I can find out what Dano's son looks like. So, please put it back on."
"Netflix is not trustworthy!After trying this service for a month which was supposed to be free, I cancelled after couple of days as couldn't find several movies I wanted to watch. Despite all notification about cancellation, Netflix still took ¬£10 and then ¬£13 from my bank account!I had to ask for refund in my bank and was told that this is common for this service. I would never trust them again!! Therefore my bad experience needs to be recorded - for others and will share it with my friends..."
"I have used netflix for almost five years, but now I am considering cancelling it.It used to be better at finding new shows and films that I'd like, but it always recommends things that I wouldn't like. It's changed it's review settings from a star rating system to a thumbs up system.. I always prefer the star rating system (like on trustpilot), because it's much more precise at ranking the quality of the film/show.Although netflix does offer a lot of good content, it's been a long time since their own brand shows have interested me. House of cards was great, but Kevin Spacey ruined it all, which isn't netflix's fault, but since that show, I haven't seen many alternative in-depth dramas that keep my attention. I may cancel it if they don't create any appealing new shows soon.Netflix could be great, but it seems to be getting complacent after becoming so popular. I will give it a month or two, before deciding to stay or leave."
"Hosts conspiracy  theorists and extremists"
"Unoriginal content and ruined my childhood with the magic school bus remake. No commercials? Cool. Unoriginal and bias content? Not cool Netflix."
"I think that overall Netflix is good. The only complain I have is that sometimes I don't get the language or the subtitles that I would like to have, because those are depending on the country from where you are watching it. The offer is quite vast. Quality is very good. No issues with streaming whatsoever. You should try other competitors (such as the 3 letter one starting with S and ending in Y) to understand how amazing Netflix is."
"I have been use Netflix for almost 5 years, recently I can't watch it on my laptop due to many error caused by their website for the past 3 months, after chat with their tech online,nothing solved, so I canceled my service,then I received my bill which it shows 1 dollar more than my usually bills and it's for next month which I canceled already, why I need to pay the money for nothing?After I called Netflix, very hard to understand what are they talking on the phone, English skills even worse than me, the I have been told that I can't get my refund,how rude this company is? Do not buy their service!"
"Absolutely nonsense.  Bought a new smart TV so thought I would connect to their free 30 day trial. 45 minutes later and then a promise of a call back in 1 hour nothing happens. Then I get an email saying""oh yeah your TV is too smart this is a known problem. Contact maker of TV to downgrade settings. Absolutely no good. It's not free if it doesn't work. They said use another device. Doh I want to watch it on TV. Bad customer service. Bad sales."
"As a natural binge watcher, when I found out about Netflix, it stole my heart. Science fiction, fantasy, comedies, horrors... Netflix has it all. But in the last year I‚Äôve started to notice the NEW Netflix flaws that I‚Äôve never witnessed before. (If Netflix ever had flaws, fans could tolerate it due to everything that Netflix has to offer) As a foreigner I prefer to watch my movies and shows with ENGLISH subtitles because it helps me understand and learn everything 1000%. I‚Äôve spotted so many shows and movies that subtitles don‚Äôt match the words the actors are saying ( for something as big as Netflix, that should NEVER be happening ) And my biggest issue. How many shows have been cancelled after two or three seasons?! Santa Clarita Diet, Disjointed, Hemlock Grove and FIVE marvel series?! ( I didn‚Äôt even count in the good ones ) From a binge watchers point of view, this is outrageous. Why do we pay for Netflix if they add dozens of NEW series every year but never go for more than a few seasons with the ones we already have?!  How does Netflix  expect their fans to commit? Netflix thinks that as long as they keep putting out new stuff, we‚Äôll be happy?! Ohh, no. If we committed to Netflix that means that we want to commit to our favourite shows as well  and not have to worry that it will be cancelled after 10-20 episodes. I can‚Äôt say. There have been a lot of shows that have been cancelled after a season or two but only Netflix has the biggest choice of movies and shows but NEVER enough seasons. Netflix has bitten off more than it can chew and that is why everyone will stop paying for it and find something worth their loyalty! In the soon future, Netflix will be forgotten just like MySpace. Why? Netflix has taken its ‚Äúfame and popularity‚Äù for granted!"
"Host of movies and shows to choose from, which is awesome obviously but there's a lot of room for improvement. My husband loves action and war movies, but the vast majority of them are in another language, like Korean or something. And don't have the option for subtitles at least, which really sucks. I don't know if it's at all possible, but constantly updating the site with a series' newer episodes would be wonderful, instead of having to wait until God knows when to hear about the release date for the newest season of a show. When searching for a movie that's not even on the site, it probably will still pop up, though it's not actually available. I also think that it takes too long to update with new shows and movies. People can oftentime run out of things to watch that peak their interest pretty fast. I like that Netflix tries to add to the variety by making their own films, which is a nice attempt. Overall, I use it and think it's ok, but I definitely have to have Hulu or some other streaming service to go along with it because it won't cut it working alone."
"I find myself with very mixed feelings about this service, a few years ago it was absolutely great, good shows & fair prices. . Now though, it seems content is uploaded with little regard to quality or quantity, some shows (particularly for younger viewers) have completely random seasons & are in no particular order, whereas others have just been completely abandoned long before reaching any sort of conclusion.The originals, which were at one time the best shows/films on the service, now seem low quality & rushed, choosing to upload as many as possible rather than spending time & resources on making a couple of good ones. It isn't all bad though, for killing time at the end of the day there are worst things out there, however the rising price of a subscription doesn't seem to be reflected in the overall experience & that's a real shame, especially considering this hasn't always been the case.."
"Netflix started out as a really good company, but as they grew their service suffered. They've Netflix originals which was amazing for a streaming service. The fact that they could afford to produce their own shows, but the problem is after the 3rd season most of their shows are axed. I cancelled my account a few days ago after they cancelled Santa clarita Diet. I wouldn't recommend Netflix, because of their constantly increasing prices and lack of quality programming. Hulu and Amazon are honestly cheaper."
"I work nights so when I get off in the morning I want to watch Netflix, but every time I try to get on Netflix doesn't work properly. Why is that ? I pay my bill so I should be able to watch when I want and what time I want to."
"The representative I spoke with did not know the correct information due to the issue I'm having. I kept being put on a silent hold without being told and having response not fully answered.  Issue has not been resolved. I truly hope they know how to keep cuomsers satisfied."
"Netflix really not the best anymore they keep canceling popular shows and fans are out raged"
"What can I say? Sometimes they have a gem, like House of Cards, etc. But mainly it's garbage that's not that great. But the worst thing is that their trailers automatically play every time you log in or roll your arrow over a show. Some of these trailers are very annoying. I emailed them and asked them how to stop it, and they said I couldn't.Luckily I found a plug-in for my browser that stops it. But forcing you to watch irritating trailers? Netflix went from a four to a three star, so still work paying for, but they don't consider their customers very well."
"it use to be great with fab series and film, but now seems to be more and more foreign, subtitled stuff. I honestly will give badly dubbed over series a go, but you miss all the action with subtitles. Recently added just exists with this rubbish!! And they ignore all feedback asking for choices to stop them showing up in first place. Recently added doesn‚Äôt show all recently added and no where to check them via app on TV, even when search it, doesn‚Äôt show them all!Plus the fact they never seem to give a series a chance and do one series that is it... cancel it. Need to try at least 2 to 3 and end it properly, as nothing worse than getting into a series for it to end with no ending......  Ones they do that are really popular get cancelled anyway after 4 or 5.Think they need a new boss to sort it all out! The price tag doesn‚Äôt match what paying for anymore!"
"Why the hell do you people cancel shows that are good !!  (Ex. Santa clerita diet ) I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in you people and I have lost all faith that Netflix can actually make good decisions on shows. I‚Äôm canceling my subscription to nextflix screw you people!!!!"
"I've not had any issues with their service, pricing, or customer service. I have multiple profiles set up for each of my family and none of us have issues. Sometimes the GUI is a little overwhelming when trying to search for something and the suggestions tend to be a little off but other than that I really enjoy the service."
"If I can give  Netflix 0.   I would say they are the worst company for changing your plans without notifying you.  I just got off the phone with Netflix and they told me only way I could have changed my plan was that I had called in or I had done it online which I had not done, the guy wanted to argue with me about it and finally I told him to cancel my plan my subscription I will not be going back to Netflix it‚Äôs ridiculous that They can change your plans and blame it on the customer.  Enough is enough.  they have done this to us before and I let go but not anymore Netflix is permanently out of our household and it will not come back if I could give them a zero rating I would I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that we can‚Äôt give them a zero rating they do not deserve even a one"
"I 'm not sure if it's different in the US but it seems like the options of the European Netflix are limited. You can still find some quality movies and shows but I m sure there is space for improvement."
"Until they fix their very bad customer service they only deserve 1 star"
"fantastic!! best movies selection. i love it"
"awesome!! love it"
"For being a multi million dollar company netflix has really lame/boring movies and not enough classic popular shows. Netflix is worth more than Disney and Comcast. Cmon Netflix step up your damn game and add all tv Old/New show and movies. YOU CAN AFFORD IT NOW WITH THE UPCHARGE TO 13.00 a month."
"The best service with online movies. The largest selection and the best productions."
"I don't have a Netflix account.  That, however, hasn't stopped someone from using my bank details to pay for their own access to Netflix services for the past two months -- as I've just discovered.  Thankfully, my card hasn't been used for any other illicit purchases, so this is purely a Netflix-related problem.  However, that didn't stop the Netflix representative I spoke to from blaming me for being careless with my card (even though, as I pointed out to her, it hasn't been used for anything else, so it's clearly not identity theft).  She'll now block my card from being used to make any more payments, which means -- she told me -- I can't set up a Netflix account myself using that card.  Frankly, with that level of service and responsibility, I wouldn't want to."
"For what you pay the service and selection they offer is fantastic"
"I've just spoken to a representative at Netflix. Firstly I got straight through which I thought was amazing in comparison with other companies. The lady I spoke to was very helpful and patient and resolved my issue, waiting patiently on the phone whilst she checked I was all sorted. BIG UP Netflix  and THANK YOU!"
"I can‚Äôt say anything I am shocked in good and bad ways, Just avarage."
"The customer advisor I spoke to was cheeky.She Was a foreigner who I couldn't understand.She was not good.Im now thinking of cancelling my account."
"I can no longer watch Netflix because of the auto trailers it's so flipping annoying and to add insult to the injury they're raising the monthly subscription. I'll pay it if you end those stupid trailers you frickin morons."
"After three years of good service and low payments $8.99/2 screens I am done. I went from paying $8.99 to $10.99/mo for the same service and no additional benefits. This morning I woke up to check my bank account only to find Netflix went up in price to $12.99! FOR TWO SCREENS. That‚Äôs equivalent to paying $7 per screen which is already their basic 1 screen plan. I called and was told by a representative an email was sent out, however during the phone call I checked and there was no such email. Not only have they gone up so much in price you do not get anything extra for the $12.99 other than an extra screen. No added benefits like Hulu, HBO, Stars, etc. I understand inflation and the need to keep up with other companies, but they really do not have anything to offer. No new Disney movies like the raves about (only select), no new movies past 2010, new shows are rare to find, and you can‚Äôt even rent a movie like they offer either. It‚Äôs really not worth the $12.99 price, PLEASE LOOK AT ALL YOUR OPTIONS before joining this company."
"Love the shows, however this new Autoplay feature is extremely bad. Plays movies, cant get them to stop. Controls are messed up cant go back or stop things easily. Seems like they made it this way on purpose. Just makes me mad. Even after you log on to there website to turn off auto play, it keeps on happening."
"I really loathe the way if you are searchig for something rather than say it is not available they show titles relating to the theme. It is intensely annoying. I would love to watch more European stuff as well the range is pathetically limited in the UK . I along with other am also fed up with the amount of alternative rights themes - I am just after entertainment not ideology from the USA Gradually getting fed up of the service to be honest and may terminate."
"Netflix requires a fleet of UX DESIGNERS to correct the course of Cindy Holland's incessant, misguided, data-driven-mantra regarding a lack of viewers as justification to kill a show.  Why do we not watch? Let US  (NOT your Data) count the ways, cuz what you don't know about VIEWERS is a LOT. YOU lose us for YOUR lack of commitment to investment and CONSISTENCY; 10 shows does NOT a season make.  THAT would be a ""viewer-beware"" Mini-Series.  DO NOT cultivate hopes of submerging our imaginations in new world's only to leave us fuming at time-wasted on a great show YOU kill because YOU only invested 1 or 2 HALF-seasons that frustrated viewers due to YOUR half-baked commitment to consistency, story n character development. Humans have ALWAYS longed to deeply soak our overburdened minds in great stories told well, with polish and penache, intelligence, wit, raucous and touching humor, be they contemporary, futuristic or historical tales n drama in fantastical and exotic or down to earth and intimate locations.  We ALWAYS will. Butthis woman's ""data-driven decision"" tunnel-vision-formula bears NO conception of why viewers ""Binge-Watch"" nor does she seem to understand the Cultural, Social, Intellectual and Psychological, HUMAN FACTORS  underscoring the reasons WHY popular series become part of a collective-soul psyche or a niche psyche to REMAIN popular.  Respect your Viewers AND Creators; give Cindy Holland's job to a TEAM of UX Designers who can excite the colors of our story-telling canvas with more than just a Paint-By-Numbers Formula that leaves us ALL looking elsewhere for some solid commitment to satisfying our Human jones for Entertainment ."
"So, the yankkks decided to get rid of the reviews... Almost as if they wanted to try and hide just how awful their selection of trash is. Amazing how there can be just so much garbage, without any quality at all. If there is anything decent, it's deleted quickly. Endless repeats that we've already seen 100 times on BBC or C4. Racist trash from your favourite israeli war criminals, sold as entertainment. It's bad."
"Awful company. We had fraudulent actively on our account, Netflix only offered to do a part refund and said we won‚Äôt do anything else to help you. They refused to send an email, transfer to someone else or send us the recorded call, they then didn‚Äôt want to answer anymore calls so terminated the call. I am not happy at all and will take this further."
"Afwul customer service!! I signed up for a free trial, and continued to subscribe after one month. Then one day I checked my netflix account to see when the next payment would be (because I wanted to end my subscription).  Guess what - Netflix has been charging me for the PREMIUM subscription for 4 screens(!!!). There was not one mention ANYWHERE of exactly what this premium subscription covered. What normal person needs FOUR SCREENS as the default standard?! So I called customer service and guess again - there is zero help to get whatsoever. I'm only paying for HBO and Viaplay from now on, thank you very much."
"wost app never go for free trial . i tried first time form my device to register for free trial. i sign up for one month free trail then got mgs verifiy your card detail and send me otp as soon as i entered otp  funds got debited form account and i call up customer service they said  refund will  take 30 business days to refund back to account . i think they are working in 18th century. there are taking so much time for simple refund. customer service in not good and wost service"
"One of the worst Customer Services I ever experienced. Relying on the system rather listening to the customer problem. Very patronising. Netflix charged my credit card for the service they should not charge for. Absolute waste of time. Very disappointed with the Customer Service. Don't even bother to call them. No solutions to your problems."
"Just wondering if anyone else has had problems with Netflix losing current credit card details and reverting to previous details which have been invalid for some 16 months?  I am wondering whether there may be problems with their system and am concerned my credit card details may not be secure.I have tried to talk to Netflix customer service but they are not really interested."
"Have been an active Netflix subscriber for several years and haven't experienced any significant issues with my service. Of course there have been price increases over the years, subscription plan changes, and the removal of Netflix's much-loved ratings/reviews system. I use the Android app and Smart TV app frequently with no problems. Haven't dealt with customer service yet."
"Generally reliable and has content for almost anyone to watch. I would recommend Netflix to anyone."
"Service is terrible and the application really slow specially when streaming. Bad Customer service and careless for their clients"
"I love Netflix even though they are getting bad about using the price sooooooo often! I do hate the fact that they have quit listening to the viewing audience, especially since we Are the ones that make them rich! We aren‚Äôt allowed to vote in which series stays on or is axed! Like I would like to be able to say ‚Äú Hey! Bring back another series of ‚Äú Most Beautiful Thing‚Äù or another one... I don‚Äôt speak Spanish or Turkish, but some of them are my favorites! Yet I can‚Äôt express it? I first thought Netflix was going to be the first to revolutionize that barrier but now it looks like they are royally screwing that up! What a shame! They need  competition ! They started out great but now just mucking it up!!! They tease you with a great international series only to cancel... I mean what the hell! Some brilliantly stupid dweebs! Quite obviously!"
"I love Netflix. There is always something good to watch. I'm really loving all the netflix own stuff I've seen so far. And I also love that I can watch things in Italian with subtitles. Netflix is well worth the money when I think about the fact that one film can cost ¬£3 to hire on other platforms."
"I am always watching Netflix in my free time, and I watch more Netflix than I watch tv these days. The netflix original shows have such a variety and the shows which are not made by them entertaining. Also I love the download feature and I use that all the time"
"Most of it sucks these days movies, TV shows. Its basically all what Netflix made which some of us dont want to constantly watch and if there is regular movies and TV shows they tend to not be interesting at all or just lame."
"Netflix are too dismissive, even patronising when dealing with technical complaints. Particularly when it involves their mobile streaming and and casting. Casting from a phone to TV continuously stuttering on both sound and picture. You have sound but no picture when casting from a Tablet. Once you confirm you have carried out all their checks on settings the reply is always the same - ""..it must be a problem with our software, I will pass it on to our IT department"". The reply has been the same for the last 4 or 5 years. Amazon Prime - excellent sound and picture when casting!"
"Received an e-mail from Netflix in December 2018 confirming that the e-mail and password on my account had been successfully changed (?) and that I could continue to enjoy the service. Because I hadn't accessed the account settings it was obvious something was amiss.I tried to watch Netflix on my TV but couldn't get on because the e-mail and password didn't match! I then rang Netflix Customer Service in the USA to be told that my account had been hacked - apparently this is common in the USA and people ""buy"" your subscription? - and was currently being activated on various devices. I was told that they could delete the account and the payment details used for payments and that it was advisable if I wanted to continue that I should use a different e-mail address and payment method as an extra safeguard. I did this and moved on happy that it was all sorted. Problem is that when I received my quarterly Bank statement I find that Netflix have continued to take ¬£9.99 per month for the old ""cancelled"" account as well as the ¬£7.99 that I now pay via Paypal for the new subscription!!When contacting the Netflix Customer Service today I'm now told that the old account is still active on devices in the USA under another different e-mail and password combination hence the reason why I'm still be charged via my UK Bank Account. To add insult I'm told that the payments can't be refunded but the devices using the account have again been deactivated and I won't be charged any more in the future. The no refund clause is apparently in the small print as the service has been used (not by me!!) Checking various forums I'm finding that this ""account hacked"" thing is a fairly common occurrence and sympathy from Netflix staff seems a rarity. As no guarantee could be given that this wouldn't / couldn't happen again I've decided to completely cancel my Netflix subscription and resolve to check my Bank statements every month!!"
"Not using the service, but tried the free trial month and been charged after that cause I forgot to cancel. They were happy to assist and refund me immediately even though it was me who did not cancel."
"Great movies and series! I love the download functionality."
"Great range of movies and shows and great value. Sometimes shows/films don't stay on long enough so if they could develop a stream like Amazon of items leaving soon that would be great.I would prefer if Netflix stopped moving things around like search which is confusing and not have a limit on how many titles you can add to your list.I would recommend and have converted everyone in my family into Netflix bingers!"
"Great platform don‚Äôt realise how there is so much hate"
"Weird how you only how one or five star reviews... Something is fishy here.Either way, I do not understand how someone can hate on Netflix! It is the best streaming platform out there, hands down! You have got as great variety of movies from all genres, old and new. Tons of TV series. And the Netflix originals, some of whom are really exceptional! Hating on Netflix just because it doesn't have your favourite movie seems silly and childish."
"Most of your Chinese and Japanese movies or madrian or Korean you can't hear in English the all of my old school very old school kung fu movies I can do English why can't I do it on Netflix what's up with that and I got over not override say about a hundred kung fu movies most of them are very old school people you guys never even heard of so what's up with that please change that so I can hear it in English thank you I appreciate it by the way you do live in USA people speak English just saying don't want to read the movie I want to watch it the whole point of the movie is to watch it if I want to read it as read the book which I have just saying again"
"The sound output volume from netflix is so low that i have to keep switching back to regular tv channels to convince myself that i'm not going deaf. No other app or input shows up this issue on my new lg oled tv."
"Netflix is the best tv app out there. My kids can finally agree on a show since they have endless options. I will definitely be renewing my subscription"
"Netflix is missing a TON of movies and shows that is just a plain given with 90% of services that u pay for service.  Request after request.  How can you not have Contact, Lord of the Rings, and so much more, oh and Twister, Paying too much for lack of popular movies new and old.  GO with another Streaming Service."
"I love Netflix. Apart from having some of my fave series and films available, their own stuff is sometimes unexpectedly awesome too! Every time they put a new 'Netflix Original' I have to have a watch it to see if it's any good. It usually is! I'm not so much in to the documentary things, but that's just me. Definitely worth the subscription."
"A fraudulent transaction has shown up on my credit card for netflix.com. I called netflix who said they can't/won't reverse it as it was more than the arbitrary 7 days ago (it was 10 days ago). It is entirely unethical, if not illegal to keep a payment you know has been stolen - it makes you an accessory to this crime. Yes I know I can go through the process of backbilling it through my credit card company and yes I will do that, but it is no wonder fraudsters are targetting your company with this approach to customer service."
"I've been subscribing to Netflix for a few years. Unlike bbc iplayer (which drives me completely potty)  I never have streaming issues or buffering and unlike bbc iplayer it doesn't take six hours to find what you are looking for (only a very slight exaggeration!). I think the range of programmes to watch is consistently pretty good, sometimes excellent, and I often rewatch series I've especially enjoyed like Bloodline, Line of Duty and others and documentary series like Chef's Table.There are exceptions, such as the current so-called documentary about Madeleine McCann which is undoubtedly the worst programme Netflix has ever screened and can scarcely be called a documentary at all. Bad choice. My sub costs about ¬£6.95 a month. Very good value overall in my view."
"Good service, well streamed and a very good range of fresh shows!Been with then for 4 years without issue!"
"What an absolute joke! I pay ¬£15 a month for Netflix through sky and every couple of weeks most of my programmes on Netflix will not play it will come up with ""cannot play this title at the moment"" when I ring Netflix they always blame it on sky and vice versa iv had enough so I'm now going to cancel. Not paying for a service I'm not getting use of. Stay away people."
"Until they make the automatic preview of series and movies optionable it can never be more than one star. It has decreased our amount of browsing and also the amount of choosing the netflix application when searching for something new to watch. Netflix says that decreasing the amount of browsing is something positive but being hesitant to open the application cannot be. They have generalized their users incorrectly."
"Amazing for the price and great quality content"
"I'm giving u a 2 and only because u have movies not saying they are good because their not they suck most are geared towards kid  young adults  who the hell watches this crap then I find out the reason why we dont get high rated movies is because u have to pay for them god forbid we have to pay for yr service but u cant pay to put a good movie up.the only reason I have it is for the kids you keep sending me notices about movies why I've report yr emails as spam but does no good I dont want to read about yr low budge movies and from the looks of the reviews looks like canceling the subscription is going to be a blast to.Oh lucky me I'm not to please of u raising yr prices for wat,wat is it that u raised the price for"
"Idiotic decision of auto playing previews..."
"bought a netflix account but cant find the movies my friends are watching , smh.."
"I have used Netflix for around 5 years or more now. This is my number one go to service and here's why:1. For all the content (old and new) it half the price of SKY and has something for everyone's taste. 2. You can pick it up and take it on the go and instantly carry on where you left off.3. It constantly has new content added and most of the Netflix originals are far superior to the hit and miss films they release these days.Also the actual price has increased once in 5+ years...... ONCE! And it was like a total of an extra ¬£1. You just can't beat it!"
"The entire service is shut down for tablets meaning I can't enjoy movies on a bigger screen. This problem has been going on for weeks and they just told me oh well! Whenever we get the issue fixed we'll send an email. Now they took my money but basically telling me pluck off. An wait til we can get this problem fixed. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!! Not even going to accommodate me for my days of lost service. I'll be contacting the BBB. First T-Mobile now this. These companies will never learn until they get tired of going back an forth to court"
"absolute utter crap, out of focus after just a few minuts, anyone who rates this service above 2 is a complete moron or lier and at very best seriously needs to stop driving whilst wearing glasses and get their butt into specsavers for a well overdue eye test. don't waste your time and money watching this as it's like watching those dodgy counterfiet dvd's from the 90's."
"I deleted my account around two years ago and they still take my money once in a while even though i already blocked them in my bank. Hate Netflix!"
"We are waiting 2 month for Greek subtitles in vikings. We stuck in season 4 episodes 10. One of the best series in Netflix. You are unacceptable!!!"
"Netflix is great, cannot fault. Always something new to get hooked on! Plus the one time I needed support the team were efficient and helpful."
"Netflix is nice for my favorite tv series,movies and good value for money to download the movies ,but the collection of movies is relatively low, they should be add some good collection of movies .tv series of netflix is superb, love the series of dark,rain,supernatural. Add some more fantastic tv series."
"No option to remove annoying auto preview at top of page.Often get bombarded by unwanted bass and sound!!!!"
"Bad customer service and idiotic developers.Why would they make 4k streaming exlusive to Microsoft Edge and the Netflix app from the Microsoft store? Only 4% uses Edge/IE and i bet even fewer of the users use the Netflix app. Meanwhile almost 80% uses Google Chrome. But why develop for majority of users? Why would that make any sense! It would be much much better to develop our services to the 4% who are too dumb to download chrome."
"Great application, cheap and good variety of things to watch and no ads :) great service."
"Have a nice verity of movies and show. format is easy to follow and best of all No Commercials!"
"Love altered carbon, the original Netflix series. Will get you guys the remaining 1 star after a month using it :) !"
"Giving 5 stars for the entertainment I got. Liked few seasons like nightflyer, lost in space, Dark, Altered carbon and few more.I am totally addicted to Netflix. Great job Netflix keep it up."
"With so many other streaming options available, I can no longer recommend Netflix. They have long lasting (months & months) technical issues & very poor customer service. Every rep on the phone tells me something different & no one seems to know anything. Request to speak with a supervisor was denied."
"happy customer, please add more classic, go to movies!"
"Great tv shows and great value for money compared to other companies"
"some good stuff but terrible customer service. the reviews have gone and trying to contact them horrendous..."
"Why 3 or 4 starts for netflix ? Netflix is amazing. Lost in space, Black mirror,altered carbon... these are the best SCI FI serials i have ever watched. Currently watching nightflyers and i am loving it. Netflix is the best thing ever happened to internet."
"Netflix is nice for my favorite tv series. Hope they had lowered the monthly subscription rental. I do not watch any movies, just the tv serials. Hope someone from the company will add low-priced plans for people who watch just tv series."
"Im thinking of leaving.. the movies that they show ive watched years ago to many movies are subtitled. And alot of the movies are crap. So im paying ¬£7.99 a month just to watch the new star trek discovery which is aired once aweek..hmmmm."
"Good value for money to watch and download movies, tv series legally. But the collection is relatively low. Needs to add more movies, tv series. Would be great if they add some good collection of classic movies."
"Been watching for a month now and am really impressed with the variety of shows on offer.Also great that you can watch on 2 tv,s.Guess there might come a time when you may have watched everything , but I don't see that happening for a while as there is so much choice."
"I just spoke to a customer service representative about why they where charging me money on an account that was not in use, and was suppose to be cancel. They were unable to return me my money which is over 100 dollars own to me. They guy I spoke to told me to dispute that with my bank and when I ask him to provide his information like his full name he told me he can‚Äôt do that???? Now I am concern, how come he is able to look at all my personal information like my debit card number and full name but hi is unable to provide me his full name? They told me they been charging me for an account that was clear to them I was not using on any device? And told me to dispute it with my bank !!! I am so done with this company!!!!"
"Great variety of shows, just a little angry that the Marvel shows are now cancelled"
"Brilliant array of programming, both original content and from big and small production companies alike.You can set different profiles for different household members, and it even has a kids section just for the little ones. You can also create profiles for the kids and lock it so that they are only shown age-appropriate content on their profile."
"I would happily give these guys 10/5 and pay double the monthly fee. I am not joking. My reasons for this are:I have had no issues at all with the serviceI went from paying Sky TV ¬£50 to ¬£10 a month for NetflixSky and terrestrial TV is full of adverts but Netflix has noneMost of what is on Sky are repeats of ancient programmes or nasty 3rd rate US programmes (the ones the Americans use as fillers) with few items on their pay channels I actually miss. Netflix has masses of original and quality content and if I want to look at old films and TV shows they have a lot of good ones.At best Sky was HD and a lot of content was SD whereas Netflix has a lot of 4K and other stuff is all HD."
"Their priorities obviously aren‚Äôt where they were 2 years ago, I remember when the movies were regularly updated and were actually good. The movies are getting older and we can get the same variety from a lesser free app like popcorn flix. For them to up the price but give nothing back kinda sucks too. Might be cancelling my account and switching if Netflix doesn‚Äôt get their sh#t together"
"Signed up with Netflix thinking I was only going to be charged $8.99 per month. After a few months I looked at my credit card statements and saw that I was actually being charged $15.14 each month. I called Netflix to have them correct the issue and only charge the $8.99 I originally thought I was getting. The manager stated that he would not credit my account the $10 overage for the two months and stated that their customers are smart enough to read their bills. Horrible customer services. canceled my service."
"Loved it when we first subscribed but now the content is not as good.Can't really find anything decent to watch appear from the odd series. There is a lot of foreign language films but you don't know they are foreign/subtitles until you start watching.I think I need to unsubscribe."
"I found a movie on Netflix...Called the Babysitter...the most disgusting movie ever..apparently is for kids...is about  human sacrifice  satanic rituals and overall disgusting I called Netflix to tell them how inappropriate that is Next day in the evening I'm watching Netflix and a background female voice is Saying ""Viewers discretion is adviced as some movies are violet etchThe voice didn't finish the sentence and it start laughing in a very creepy way Of course I call again and share my experience but of course nothing could be done This is one issue Second issue such disrespect to the customer you don't know how long you have to wait for new episodes to be uploaded on Netflix I'm so done with itABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!!"
"I sent a request to privacy email to delete my account, as instructed in their help section, but they responded with automatic bot -no one's reading it."
"I was big fan of Netflix when I joined. Now there is nothing left to watch. Few old Hollywood movies. But everything else is rubish and wast of time. I don't watch anything made by Netflix it's all low budget rubish. I am cancelling my membership."
"I was a customer for two years. I understood that occasional glitches etc happen to all internet based businesses. But I couldn't access Netflix for 2 weeks and when I tried to contact customer service, they would turn the live chat off. One of the advisers was forcing me to download chrome which makes me think that Netflix and chrome are in partnership. I told him no - I'm Mac user, safari is the browser I use. He switched off the chat. Another advisor when asked if Netflix was no longer supported by safari answered of course it is - Netflix is a website. Then switched off the chat. Finally I cancelled the membership - that the customer service was more than happy to do."
"Good for short time,in few weeks you have seen mostly the good movies after that not much"
"It's good to begin with but not enough new stuff. It was 7.99 then it changed to 9.99 for the same thing"
"What an amazing streaming platform makes it really easy to catchup with all my tv shows!"
"noting new all old movies we pay ¬£10 a month"
"Absolutely shocking customer service. Account was hacked called through to find out how this may of happened and how do I prevent this, my whole settings were changed from parental control to allowing adult content. I have a small child who can access this content. I spoke with an extremely rude agent and even more unhelpful supervisor who quite frankly need retraining if not sacking. Will he cancelling immediately"
"Gotta love the fact that you can just sit back, relax, and watch tons of series for such a cheap price. Netflix is amazing!"
"Netflix is boring! You‚Äôll be better off spending your money with a different movie provider. Netflix has a poor selection of movies to chose from.Too expensive, always raising the prices and never providing the greatest selection of movies."
"Netflix is great website and app to use but they need more new films and shows."
"Netflix is an amazing app to watch TV series, I use it with all my family extremely cheap only 13‚Ç¨ a month!"
"Nice website and really fast, but in my country you don't have a lot of tv shows..."
"I really like Netflix they are helpful when you call in.   I have been a long standing customer even when I didn't have internet I would continue to pay, however I don't like the fact that they could not even move my payment date 3 days away for me nor could they wave one months payment just for being a great customer.  Hulu did, I'm having a crisis at this time."
"Ex customer. Got an email offering a month free trial. Would not accept my debit card which I used before and which is well in credit. Did not offer a solution other than, buy a Netflix gift card and use that to pay. Absolute rubbish."
"Love Netflix on my Amazon fire stick. It's so good I cancelled sky tv and saved myself a fortune"
"Not even too sure where to start because Netflix offers such a wide selection of series and shows, all for a cheap price."
"So many netflix original shows and much more await on a cheap subscription model. No reason to not have netflix by now!"
"Account hacked, incompetent livechat staff. I Provided them with paypal billing ID and everything they wanted however their system doesnt recoknize it. Just got robbed off 1 month sub by someone 5000 miles away."
"I've had great experiences with Netflix. I love their services, and I've had great experiences with them. Their customer service is mediocre, but it's still decent. Unfortunately, I think they're discontinuing Netflix services for the Wii which I am unhappy about, but overall, I've loved Netflix."
"I have been a member with with Netflix since 2013. Recently, I have had an issue where during a show it will flick off and load the next the episode. I called Netflix to let them know what the service was doing and they told me they would email me and article about how to fix the issue. I then told them that I feel as though I should be credited because the service was not working. They offered to only credit it for the month if I cancel the service. So it looks like I will be joining Crave tv."
"I love netflix despite every single tv series are online to watch but it has an app for iphone which is amazing and i get premium every single month without paying 1 cent!Thank you for amazing registration system!"
"rubbish every film i look up i wana watch not there rubbish not worth 7.99 no way"
"Netflix My Buddy - On the go I do watch netflix more than youtube. Recently i developed this habit because of their quality content. Keep it up Netflix!"
"Good shows, very fast via smart tv and browser."
"Yeah it's cool but can we have some better shows? I'm starting to question why I pay for this.."
"When I called I was on hold for a few minutes but no big deal and as soon as she came on she saw right away my issues and resolved it in less than a 2 min phone call. Very positive experience."
"They charge your credit card every month until you don't cancel. I don't read rules & regulation much, somewhere it seems they have written that the credit card will be charged unless plan is cancelled. It is my fault too for not checking at my statements. I signed up just to watch this particular movie & thought after a month my account will be deactivated as there won't be any payments. I was wrong they had been charging me automatically for 10 months. After long dispute, they agreed to return 6 mnths payment."
"Those of us with satellite service in rural areas can no longer use Netflix which stopped supporting time-shifting systems. It's inexplicable when it worked well and didn't conflict with anti-copying policies.Reed Hastings et al, you'd be better off with efforts to provide service to all rather than to discriminate against customers in rural areas."
"Terriable service. You cant even have your account erased. On top of very bad service when you need it."
"WHY HAS SEASON 1-5 BEEN REMOVED OF NETFLIX ON THE 1/1/19 I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WATCHING SEASON 4 AN ALL OF A SUDDON THEY HAVE DISSAPEARED !!!!!!!!"
"Great use every day, could do with a few more TV box sets that I could binge on"
"I love Netflix & chilling! They have a wonderful selection of things to watch and produce a lot of very good series and movies themselves. Not sure why the poor ratings on here though. I have thoroughly enjoyed Netflix over these past few years and look forward to seeing more in the future!!! :)"
"Netflix keeps getting better, except for the adverts. Their price is reasonable. Their content library changing over time can be irritating but it also keeps it fresh.The interface is slick but has become loud and a little advert like since they added adverts for other content and auto-play very fast on hover.Original content is groundbreaking and I hope for far more in the future."
"Absolutely no problems giving this company 5 star. Great service, great value."
"I joined Netflix from Denmark after getting confirm from their customer support that I could share my account with my family abroad (Spain). Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt watch content in European Spanish from Spain, so I contacted customer support.They told me that the only solution would be to make another account from Spain.But they were not willing to give me my money back for the month I had already paid as I had watched other content.I do not think that‚Äôs fair, and what‚Äôs more important, that‚Äôs not good customer service. They didn‚Äôt solve my issue and they told me I should paid for their technical limitations. I had asked my bank for my money back. It‚Äôs a pity, as otherwise the service works fine."
"It's Christmas ,sevice internet perfect ,My sevice is a farce whenever do You want to refund me?You take monthly Provide a sub service get paid regardless attitude My sevice is so poor that you need to.look at pleasing David Pratt"
"If it ain't the 5 minutes wait for Netflix to load up it's the ""we're having trouble accessing this title for you please try again later"" even iPlayer loads up so it's better going on something that loads and it's free instead of paying for something that has trouble accessing the movies and shows they upload"
"Netflix was a good site at the time to watch some films if you had no money or time to visit the cinemas but now how wrong could I be, when I joined the site I saw films that date back to the 1980 and now we are in the new age, but where are them new movie names we asked for? Netflix makes it hard for it's customers to contact them and the only way is via phone or Facebook but I saw no email for support whatsoever so what does that say? That they don't care well, if you think about it all they care is money and that's all, nothing more nothing less.. So one thing has been proven that going to the cinema is your best chance of seeing a good film then on Netflix! So until they get their s*** together it's very difficult to recommend this service to anyone globally."
"I have just had the misfortune of contacting Netflix, they say I had 2 accounts!! Why would I for 1 Tv!!! This rude woman who is not native to the UK (understand it is world wide) She was rude and unprofessional and should NOT be dealing with customers at all, she stated there was just a very minor issue with the email addresses, .com and .uk , After checking my bank account they had charged me twice for the 1 tv account I had with them (NOT ANY MORE) Total thief's they are to think this is acceptable and charge my  account twice with out even looking into the accounts!! and perhaps realize one was not right, Her attitude is dreadful and should be looked at, What a rude person she was, And nothing will be done about her as this is the sort of person they allow to work at Netflix.. Check your accounts and make sure they are not stealing money from you as they had done with me. Now the company have this rude woman to thank for loosing another customer.."
"The movies are old, and they do not update the selection on a more regular basis. I had a basic account and wanted to try the standard for a free month they charged me straight the higher value after a week of trial. I called them that there‚Äôs been a mistake, but they were only saying there monologue. Attrocious!"
"Netflix is great if you like a few month old movies. They also have a selection of TV shows. Honestly most shows are adult based and their children content is limited. Increasing subscription prices prompted me to cancel. Netflix would only replace entertainment from your cable subscription, there‚Äôs no news on Netflix."
"I would say that they have a good selection of TV shows but the films leave a lot to be desired! My subscription is in the UK but as I work abroad I would stick with Amazon Prime if you're in the UK as it has a much better selection of films and enough TV shows to be getting on with. However, when Netflix goes wrong their customer service is truly atrocious! They belittle you and tell you in these exact words, 'it's not our problem'! If something gets to a point where one of your clients has to contact your customer services then you definitely have a problem! At least with Prime they do not patronise you and offer you a free months subscription as compensation for your troubles! Everyday for three days now I have had the same error message pop up only to be told that the error message does not exist so must be a different one. Everyday this situation has been escalated and everyday I have to start all over again through the patronising and belittling questions. Again when the whole package works it is alright-particularly considering it can be cheaper than prime(but not by much!). For what you get for that money you pay them though, it is truly shocking when things don't go according to their plan."
"Horrible! When Netflix first came out it was awesome! Now the movies are terrible quality and most of them are not even in English! Amazon Prime is the way to go! Netflix needs to step up or step down!"
"I subscribed to Netflix in the uk. It does not work at all.  Some rubbish about a proxy blocker, whatever that is. No warning when signing up. It is then up to you to contact your ISP. who has no idea what you are going on about.  Life is too short to spend hours trying to sort. AVOID Netflix. Heart attack In the making"
"Does not update enough. Films are old and have Christmas films such as miracle on 34th street all year then they take it off at Christmas. Who does that!!! It's a Christmas film to watch at Christmas yet they took it off. Absolute crap!!!!"
"Very Dissapointed. No free trial. I let My Uncle watch on My account. I started one for him and it was all working then next day BLOCKED !! He can‚Äôt have a free trial because He‚Äôs already ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô Netflix. How tight of em. Your not having 30 days free. Sad."
"What can i say except its the perfect thing to watch during a pizza break."
"What has happened to Netflix, the quality of Amazon Prime is superb, switch to Netflix on the same device and the playback is so poor the picture is completely blurred.New player needs to go back to old player..."
"The Ranch season 6 suck so bad without Rooster being in it. BRING HIM BACK"
"Slow to no customer support when they mess up. They also blame you when its their system experiencing problems and dont admit its their fault and instead have you ringing up your isp as if its something wrong with them when it isnt. Furthermore chat agents are rude accusatory and infuriating and tell lies. Made a complainy 3 months ago and never even received a response."
"Decided to try Netflix with their FREE MONTH offer.  Signed up, then found out they debited my account for a month.  On querying with an unhelpful ""chat"" support person, I was told that because my laptop is second-hand, and had been used as a Netflix device before, I wasn't eligible for a FREE month.  I wasn't even warned.  When asked for my money back and the account closed, I was told it would take 10 days to refund.  Absolute crooks!"
"It's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean my family isn't as happy as I am, because I sped a lot of time watching something, but I just love documentaries. I'm sure I'll get bored with it at some point, but not yet. Thanks for creating some of the best shows out there."
"Nothing to complain. Works perfectly on my tv, ps4, phone. Much better than Now TV."
"good service but could be a little cheaper"
"I consider Netflix a good platform with quality content, but when it comes to price I am a little dissapointed. The prices are too heavy for the simple man. They should consider that out. There are sites that give you Netflix accounts for the third of the actual price, or even less. Actually there is just one site like that, it's called Accountbot."
"While the price of Netflix is pretty standard for what it does, its getting pretty outdated and needs to be updated with more relevant content!"
"I‚Äôm so very very very vex and disappointed at Netflix u are a disgrace to the nation and the hole population how dare u think it is acceptable to take FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR off all I have to say to this is I‚Äôm cancelling my subscription and u know what I‚Äôm gonna subscribe to AMAZON PRIME ye I jsut went there!!!!!!!!!!!"
"They'll cancel all the shows you love but keep renewing shows of questionable quality.General selection of titles is atrocious and prices are ridiculously high! I live in Denmark and we pay the highest amount for a membership compared to the rest of the world and we have so little content."
"Netflix offers quite a comprehnsive catalogue of movies and tv shows. Yet, most movies are the typical b-categories / direct to dvd mediocre stuff, and it‚Äôs updated only with a few movies a month. Still at a decent price, but after a year, you may want to cancel your subscription simply because there is nothing else you would like to watch."
"Can't understand why there are only 3 overall stars. I love Netflix, and I don't think I could live without it now. Great shows , amazing Netflix originals and a brilliant interface and quality. Worth every Penny!!"
"Netflix is really average, its missing alot of popular shows...given that it's paid and that some free alternatives actually have more content, it's a bit of a letdown"
"I love Netflix but put series on like hill street blues and more classic films and TVs series then you would please me I have your 4 screen package and it's better than paying to sky and I love the idea if I don't need it I can cancel than come back to yo when I want"
"Great value for money and really reliable."
"is good but pls put some more new season of your series and also put new movies"
"There are only 2 screens playing and we have 4 screens and it doesn‚Äôt work plus the 2nd screen isn‚Äôt even mine I was hacked!!"
"Great content for the price paidEasy to deal with if any issues, simple processSpoke to customer services once and it was a great experience, friendly and professional"
"For the price, I'd expect more content. However, Netflix's original TV shows are awesome and I love the documentaries. Streaming speed is flawless. Love the option to download episodes to my mobile devices to watch on-the-go without using my data."
"U pay to watch the same thing ever month. Sad to say they need to do better"
"Netflix is a racist platform... it automatically takes your position and offers you only audio and subtitles from languages in this region... millions of people cant watch movies or series in their preffered language because netflix does not offer a free choice of audio / subtitlesThis is sad and forces me to other platforms where I can watch my stuff"
"Hardly any new shows or films added all the rest are foreign rubbish or you can watch for free using showbox"
"At first I didn't understand the Netflix hype but soon it became my main source of entertainment. The subscription is not very cheap but I watch something on Netflix almost every day"
"A good way to rewatch old shows, and some new series aswell. For the money you pay, it's well worth it!"
"for the money how can anyone complain? its next to nothing and there is something for everyone,  i use it every day and love it"
"Dear Netflix,¬†¬†¬†¬† To be quite frank with you, you have become nothing more than figurative garbage. You were once an Enterprise so colossally incredible and advanced you managed to put the entire DvD Business out of work. Jaw droppingly able to distribute and disembark massive quantities of media channels from never before seen movies and timeless TV Shows, all the way down to the most pointless of pointless documentaries regarding things no one has, or ever will take the time to even care about, and it was phenomenal. But now, the times have changed, they tides have shifted, and the air has become a little cooler, and you as a company, just can't seem to catch a cold.¬†¬†¬†¬† You have done nothing in recent times but produce terrible TV Shows and Movies from years where the hot streak was never held in Hollywood. As for the remaining pittance, of a small fraction, of scratched gold still inhabiting your terrible entrepreneurial endeavor, you either have chosen to cut, or to hide as a result of a jettisoned rating system.¬†¬†¬†¬† Nothing about Netflix ceases to disappoint me, you have quite figuratively, run out of all redeemable qualities, in addition to dropping all necessarial features to be even considered a quality professional product worth the tax levied upon its use.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ~Warmest Regards,¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Spencer R. Smith"
"Netflix has lot good subscriptions however i keep informing customer support about my renewal. I want the auto renewal. The support team is not doing the best in helping me out."
"Our card has been cloned twice, creating 4 other accounts from them even after we talked to them on the phone and they still didn't cancel our account. NEVER AGAIN. Fraud"
"For the so called ""King of series and content"", they are missing quite alot of things. Plus, it's paid aswell, which for a lacking service, is pretty bad."
"Ok but the navigation needs sorting.Has too much rubbish on there with VHS quality picture and audio especially a lot of movies from the 80s or 90s."
"Absolutely awful. They only got 1 star because I didn't have a choice.There are new movies on Netflix but veey rarely. They seem to be hell bent on ramming series,s down our throat. Even stupid Jonny English movies can't be found for all of the crap movies they have there. I have literally watched every movie on Netflix and feel they need to either get some modern movies on there, or at least, give us the ability to watch some great modern classics."
"Constantly cutting out sound.Netflix, I have taken to Trust Pilot simply because you have no email contact.I am sick to the back teeth of watching shows on Netflix to miss half the damn dialogue because od Netflix cut outs on sound, next to this, how many times does Netflix need restarting because it crashes and won't load!This service would be amazing if it actually worked. There is no excuse, Fire TV works, YouTube works, hell even Showbox works, all without crashes or sound cutouts, so why not Netflix!?Awful, just awful"
"this company follows no rolls! This was confirmed by customer service team to me yesterday. No Eurepian law no UK lawmy issue in details: I opend an account with Netflix  after my first payment in October 2017, I called Netflix asked them to remove my card details from the system and that I only will top up using gift cards, and they confirmed to me that my card details are removed and no further payment will be taken. in Feb 2018 for no reason they started taking monthly payment from me, I didn't know untill september 28th so When I saw my recent bank statement I was in shock that they have been taking this mony from my account without my consent and we have not used there serivce. and I only have one account and the only user so I know 100% no one else have access to it. I called the customer service, they told me that they don't save the call details from customers and that they know that I have not used the account and that they will stop taking money from the current month but no refound!!!! I explained but Eurepian law states that you keep a log of the calls and that you should at least refound me 3 months back they said "" We are based in Amesterdam we Do Not follow Eurepian and any UK law."
"Terrible customer sevices. They are rude. They sigh at you down the phone if you ask too many questions and as far as security goes they couldnt care less!. I was told the the chance of someone stealing my account was the same as winning the lottery. So at least 1 person a week has their account stolen?? Very very poor"
"thank u amazon prime, very nice."
"Constantly buffers. Never manage to watch anything properly. Waste of time and money...."
"I use the thumbs up or thumbs down to rate the programs i watch, but despite this i get very little content sent that is likely to be of interest to me. Recently all i seem to get is forign films. i read that netflix bought loads of bollywood and chinese films and seems over 70% of the content they send me are fom these catagories. I went through every one and thumbs down, but still they come.  Very few great films :( Think they have no interest in giving people what they want but more interested on packing out their content with poor quality material, no doubt bought cheaper than it would be to get good content.  Feel a bit ripped off to be honest."
"I canceled Netflix service last month, then suddenly it was reactivated. When I contacted them they claimed that someone reactivated the account. I know no one did, but I offered to pay for the day it was active but they said i have to pay for the whole month, and it is up to me to sign out of the account to prevent someone from reactivating the account. Why doesn‚Äôt Netflix automatically sign you out once you cancel the service. Obviously they want to make it easy so that a 4 year child can just click the button on the TV screen and reactivate it. Netflix has no business ethics and they keep increasing their rates without any improvements in their service. Never again."
"Really enjoy this site. As a binge watcher really love to watch all my favorite tv series  or movies on the spot. I just wanna know why different region have different movies or tv series, or why others have more option to see, when you pay the same for the service? :| Besides that a really good tool for all those who just love to chill."
"I am always a bit disappointed by the outdated films they have - wish they could upgrade a bit!"
"Netflix needs to update and get better quality movies half the movies or shows on here are low budget foreign or very old please do better you owe us quality we have been loyal to you for years please negotiate better deals and also get more movies rapidly very slow on the realease I am a concerned cuatomer."
"We contacted Netflix to cancel account for husband's brother who died. Auto responses, cancelled an account without asking for any identifying information and nearly cancelled mine. Terrible customer service."
"I love all the shows that netflix brings to us. The packages are amazing. I had an issue with the renewal and thanks to the support team who sort it out for me. I recommend them to all my friends."
"¬£7.99 a month.What a bargain for the content.AND,if you ONLY watch Netflix (which I  do)you can cancel the TV licence.Not having to fund the Biased Broadcasting Corporation is priceless!I had a problem setting it up,so called customer services.They could not have been more helpful.Really impressed."
"I have recently discovered that Netflix, the multi million pound company, has been taking ¬£7.99 per month from me, for the past 14 months, for an account I never activated. When I asked for a refund, I was told it was company policy to only refund 6 months worth of payments, even though it can be clearly seen that the account has never been used. If I took money from them it would be theft, but because they've taken money from me, it's company policy!! Disgusting!!"
"Great value for money for 10 pounds it‚Äôs really good , updated regular and a good mix of shows"
"I'm not sure why people are so down on Netflix; I've found it great. They could definitely have more films on there, but for a tenner a month I'm definitely getting my money's worthI've watched Power, Luther, countless films. I downloaded a few and watched recently on a flight to Mexico - this sort of technology just wasnt around until a few years ago, maybe people expect too much these days?"
"Not a lot of new content on here.  Works fine but very expensive for old content.Won‚Äôt be paying for the subscription anymore."
"I personally believe that Netflix is reasonably price and can offer a bunch of new tv shows and films for you to discover. You get a whole range different recommended films based on your recent watches. They also bring out new films and tv shows not long after they come out and they come in great quality."
"On the 26th September I got an email from Netflix offering me, in a big red box, 'another free trial'. On looking at my paypal account today I noticed that ¬£7.99 had been taken by Netflix. When querying this with customer services they stated that I was not eligible for this offer. I asked then why was I sent it! After quite a while on the phone and upon forwarding the email to them they agreed that I should not have been sent it and that it was an error by the marketing department and they wondered how many more people had been sent this by error. They, however, refused to refund my money even though they admitted that it was a Netflix error. It is only a small amount which in itself does not bother me but if this is multiplied by the hundreds, perhaps thousands of people world wide who fell into the same trap then it is little wonder why Netflix make so much money. I feel that it is bordering on fraud or at the very least dubious practise. I asked to whom I could speak to to progress my complaint and was told that there was no facility for this, they do not have a complaints department!! I am very IT literate and cannot recall any warning during the sign up process that I was not eligible, if there was it certainly was not as obvious as the red box with white writing offering me another free trial. I will stick with Now TV for my films and will never trust Netflix again!!"
"terrible they make 10 new series hope one sticks ...go back to what you were a movie site... and please not the rubbish you make..."
"What a rubbish service, has many movies and tv but all the cheap and old ones. Tried to find some recent movie like tomb raider, not even the ones by angelina jolie are on there. Terrible to think your paying to get access to film and the ones you want aren‚Äôt on there it‚Äôs a rip off, luckily I had a free trial. Terribly disappointing."
"THER REMOVED 90210 ! OMG whyyyyyyyy!!!!!!! im done ,out from netflix"
"This is far from good lately really old films in there for ages struggling to watch anything so it's gotta go. Not worth 8 quid a month if nothing to watch"
"Sorry, for ages when u started up there wasn't a huge collection of things to watch and i found myself just scrolling and finding nothing of interest. For ages now it has been so much better, loads of good choices. Now I have no choice but to message you and ask what the hell? Rick and morty is one of the best things you've ever had on and it's being taken away? These are exactly the sort of thing I pay for, this is what we want. Losing rick and morty is literally the worst thing in my opinion to date. America already gets so much more than us (for less money I might add) so when we get somthing good FINNALY why is it the fisrt thing to start disappearing? And best part, literally no way to ask anybody why this is, customer service is non existent."
"Italian catalogue is very limited, compared with other EU countries, old, boring and uninteresting. I asked them to cancel my account in order to relocate, as by stated procedure. They refused without me communicating billing information which I don't want to provide, as the account is now suspended (I stopped my subscription months ago). When asked to provide old billing information, they clearly had no idea what was in their database (they must have deleted the info at some point); totally unacceptable. Started complaint with EDPS."
"great. always works well"
"Excellent TV/movie streaming service including documentaries, drama, history, series box sets, children's programs and older hard to find classics. Netflix also have original content exclusive to Netflix. Reasonable monthly fee compared to Sky, Virgin and BT television. Netflix was pre-installed on our smart television and required activation and subscription following free trial. Easy to navigate. Highly recommended."
"I got Netflix as the new design interface looks great, the large images of films and shows, the trailers - for my mother who finds it difficult to navigate new technology. I get a free trial and open Netflix on my Apple TV 2, only to see that the design is COMPLETELY different. very basic and takes forever to find a film. Too much clicking for my mum, she finds it confusing. I have now wasted this free trial as she cannot use it without me present. Turns out the display is different on an Apple TV - but they don't tell you this. It's much better on an Amazon fire stick. Very disappointed with the customer service too, all I asked was that my  trial be extended for the inconvenience as I was going to order an Amazon fire stick. They refused to extend my free trial so I will just cancel and forget all about it. Customer service was appalling, and they even put the phone down on me whilst 'transferring' me to a manager."
"as the title says.there are constant desync issues (video / audio out of synchronization). the subs are unintuitive (e.g. watching an english language film / show and no subs appear on screen when a foreign language is used within the show, as seen no every other streaming / broadcasting platform). region lock on shows can suck a stinky dong."
"I have loved netflix and had it as my only viewing option for the past ten years or so. Lately though I have been really frustrated and annoyed with it. So many times I read the English movie title and description then start watching it and it is in another language with English captions. Ughh netflix!! This is soo annoying!!! These movies should be in a separate movie catagory!! Ive wasted so much of my time starting and ending movies like this! Annoying as Fk. I am ready to try a cable box now !!!"
"Received email notification about someone trying to log in to my account in Russia, so called the help center and very helpful rep helped me reset my password. So friendly and quick response at 9:30pm. Love Netflix support."
"Ive recently started using netflix and within the the time i have used it it has been amazing. Granted for movies it isnt the best but for series it is great i definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a site to watch series of most tv shows and movies."
"Awesome for series, too bad that there aren't many options for good movies."
"Terrible compared to their competition they are not up to depar"
"Same things also too many foreign speaking films."
"DO NOT TRUST THEM!My Netflix account was hacked. I contacted Netflix by telephone who told me I had to delete my account and start again! He tried to tell me he is sure someone I know used my password but I don't know anyone who lives in Morocco or the Netherlands! I have never been hacked before and now someone out there has my personal info. Instead of sending me info via email on how to change password etc, they cancelled everything. BAD SERVICE:"
"Wrongfully charged!Signed up to 30 days free, cancelled same day. Never used service STILL CHARGED."
"Having been a long-time subscriber to netflix since its launch in australia. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, the australian netflix has constantly faced heavily delayed releases of some popular shows and has always suffered from a lack of titles to properly fill the different genres with interesting and well made titles. I love the service netflix provides and love netflix originals even more but the netflix library is often difficult to navigate when looking for older or less popular titles of specific genres. Netflix also has a problem with not providing the highest resolution streams on chrome and you may have to use edge/safari/app to access the higher resolution streams.Overall, an awesome service but with many flaw that detract from the entire experience. I hope that Netflix can address some of these concerns for customers down under. p.s. a one person UHD streaming plan would be awesome! p.s. can we get lucifer s3 or b99 s5 anytime this year?? they've been out for a while now on other platforms so would be great to get access to them soon please."
"Binge Watching! I dont know what else i do without netflix. The best streaming app ever."
"BEWARE free trial is a trap. Be careful if you sign via appleTV. - Poor  dull content and even worse service. Will never go anywhere Netflix  in the future."
"For the last week, I have been getting 'Network error: there is a problem connecting to Netflix' Phone; spoke to a vacuous Valley Girl, who after standard, polite, sophistry, waffle; and finding it was a top update iPhone X, informed me that they knew of the problem were working to fix it, no when given, nada, just keep trying, just a digital version of, 'hit it with a hammer' !!! -I cancelled, and re-downloaded the app - et voila, working - how could she not have known this, a young technician working for NetFlix, and me a Baby Boomer crumbly, with no technical experience per se - who are these idiots - all mouth and trousers as my youth would have had it ..."
"Good service. Too many foriegn films and cartoons imo though. Not that they are foriegn, just cheapo rubbish...Anyhoo what have you done to the appearance and the way you find anything? Awfull now, to the stage that iv nearly stopped using it as nothings in real order. And why do the americans get more choice????"
"My only complaint is the is the shortage in spanish programming. Besides that Netflix is worth every penny."
"Netflix app on xbox one has washed out colours, and the app on hisense a6200 smart tv gets paused if I change soundbar volume using soundbar remote. Support staff are hopeless. Reviewer below me complaining of too much Asian content is a racist Brexit idiot."
"Offers the occasional great TV show, but has a very poor selection of movies, in the UK. It‚Äôs worth having a subscription from time to time, but there is no incentive to keep one all year round."
"I love Netflix but am very unpleased because my family and I couldn't wait for Anne with an e season 2 because we love that show we rewatched season 1 and when we were about to watch season 2 it got deleted my children cried and didn't use Netflix for a month please fix this issue"
"Worth every penny for the quality and amount of content available, I just wish I had more free time to make the most of it ahahaThe price is excellent and you get so much content to watch in comparison to rip-off services such as Sky who are just bent on milking as much money as they can from you. The platform has nearly every type of diverse programme that you could think of, and continually innovating and adding more. You get what you pay for!"
"Next to USAA, Netflix used to be my favorite company.  Every time I called with a problem, it was instantly resolved with professionalism and humor.  But over the years, my ""Saved List"" (those movies Netflix used to have but were damaged and never replaced) has grown to well over 100 titles--and not a single one has ever left the Saved List, meaning Netflix flat out refuses to replace damaged or destroyed DVDs.  It's not as if Netflix can't afford to buy replacement DVDs; the company makes over $8 BILLION/year!  Every time I talk to customer service now, I receive platitudes and empty apologies and no resolutions.  They are absolutely useless.Netflix has gone from my favorite company to one I promise to drop as soon as we find another mail-order DVD service that can compete with Netflix."
"Auto preview is annoying and can't be turned of. Bad design!üòê"
"Gone completely downhill. The majority seem to be awful REALLY awful voice dubbing on foreign films!!!!! Laughable to watch... Where's all the good stuff we're paying for??????"
"My Netflix account was hacked in June this year and the hacker upgraded my account from basic to the 4 devises (premium??).  When I called to seek support, the call handler advised that they would refund the additional charge (it was only one months charge, but the principle holds).  Netflix did not refund.I was hacked again in September and when I called again to explore the reason for a second hack (I changed all passwords on email and Netflix) I asked for someone to review my previous call about the refund.I was advised this morning that they had listened to my first call and they did not offer a refund during this call.  I asked to hear the call myself as I'm absolutely sure they offered and after they refused I asked for an escalation (there is data protection law which allows me to access data a company holds on me) and was refused...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  I don't understand why Netflix wont allow me to hear a call that would show me as a liar...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..  I have cancelled my plan.  Netflix is a joke!!!"
"It gets better all the time.  You can download films to your laptop.  Over time  I have gone from 3 stars to 5 stars."
"Love it, love it, love it"
"Customer service is exceptional! If every large corporation or company upheld the same level of service, the global economy would benefit! Well done guys."
"WARNING!!! Netflix cannot be trusted! I had a trial offer that was fine for  a period of 7 days. When I decided to take the service on day 8, using a $150 Christmas gift card from our daughter, the app would not download to our television. No service. I contacted customer service and was treated horribly. Not only was I insulted, they refused to refund the value of my gift card. I will NEVER again do business with this scam operation. BEWARE!!!"
"Been good so far (subbed for several years) but worried about up coming ads"
"Now been using their service for over a year. I think they are great value & so far we've had no issues."
"Nervt, nur...."
"Netflix has finally sunk to a new low or better rock bottom. Recently they have taken away the ability to read the movie reviews. Like you are some dummy and going to watch a show with only their small description of the movie. You can get around that by writing down shows you want to view then go to IMBD and read their write-ups  They also started playing irritating music while trying to read the short review. Netflix wants their subscribers to double dip on getting more money from you by having to use their DVD mail out service.All shows in Netflix's inventory should be streamed and the mail out service discontinued. Anyone heard of KODI?"
"Helpful and Friendly. A wide range of shows and helpful when cancelling my subscription"
"Plenty of variety for the whole family, we love you netflix x"
"Been hacked twice this year. I pay for the best package and have been hacked twice. The hacker doesn't change my password or email just watches stuff on my account and opens new profiles up. Gone through all the security things like logging out of all devices, changing email and passwords. I've even had to open 2 new email accounts just for netflix. When i contacted them through live chat I was met with rudeness and told that its my email being hacked not my netflix so it's not their problem."
"My account had been hacked and the Password & email changed from Peru!. Within minutes of calling the help line, the friendly staff reset the account, signed the hacker out and sent me a password reset link. In these days of companies with no human contact, it was a pleasure to deal with them."
"Its poor. For a service that you got to pay is very poor. The big bang theory, call the midwife and a bunch of other tv shows doesnt have the last seasons etc. You can watch a lot more without paying and even sooner than on tv. I think Netflix is too dead :/"
"Netflix as a whole is a very mediocre service but it could be great with a couple of tweaks to their policies.- When you buy a netflix subscription, they dont tell you that your subscription is based on your country. Meaning that if you live in France and you want to watch a movie in english that hasnt been dubbed in french, you can't. Also they limit your choice of series and movies based off your region, unless you live in the UK you won't have acc√®s to british series that you want to watch. Its ridiculous, the service should be one service in general and not a service based off your location. The netflix original series are good but the movies are atrocious.The comedy section is 90% stand up specials, they should put more sub categories for their movies and shows.The user interface is ok although awfully designed on pc. This subscription makes me want to go back to illegally stream movies and tv shows."
"fatphobic, homophobic, rape jokes"
"I was recently in the US visiting my sister and to be honest, their Netflix has about twice the amount of shows compared to the version we get across the pond. Aside from that I'm really happy with the value they offer. At least we get all of the Netflix originals that they put out."
"Terrible and rude operators. I had called Three times all times operators hung up on me. I was polite to them. I noticed anytime you are speaking of reimbursements they have a lot of phone problems. I will be giving my business to a company who actually care. Thank you, shawnasey johnson"
"Cmon its Netflix son! Best in the industry. Always updated , Only problem is I can never decide on what to watch"
"To register it is so easy, but to later on cancel the account they make it difficult. Not correct!"
"no subscription ! flawless service 3 different monthly payment choices even their own shows are good loving the latest sherlock holmes great docu series to suit all tastes \!"
"They remove my favourite show, ""Person Of Interest"", without notice, they could at least warn you that they will remove a show, I was halfway through watching it all. Unacceptable!"
"I am amazed that anyone would give Netflix anything less than 5 stars. Its an 'optional' monthly payment people. You do *not* have to subscribe to their service if you do not want, if you are not happy just cance.Why on this earth would anyone take any time whatsoever to come on here to write a terrible review of Netflix of all companies??? It just does not make sense.For the ten bucks we pay we get a great range of newish and old movies, tv shows and what I like to caller 'fillers', when there is nothing else on we put it on. Anyway 5 stars because its just good."
"Fair for the price. Always find something to watch even if it is rubbish.. Their own Netflix shows are alot better than the typical you can see they have thought about their audience especially with series. Also love casting everything to my Chrome cast with my phone."
"The Best Entertainment streaming site. Period! I love theie original series and movies. I hope they will continue this service forever."
"Best Internet company there is.  DVD service is also very good."
"Good service, although it would be nice if they managed to get more films and shows."
"Best app ever just wish they had more doffernt series and films on there"
"Should add more movies and mostly they add low class movies."
"Really bad range of films, most films/shows on the UK site are now in different languages so unless you're multi lingual or enjoy subtitles it will really annoy you. Not worth ¬£10 a month. Only decent thing is some of the English speaking Netflix originals are great."
"Think the selection is rubbish, once you‚Äôve had Netflix for about a month you realise how little they have and you see yourself looking over the same films time and time again"
"Great TV shows including original content but the films are some what limited. They very rarely have films I actually want to watch."
"Entertaining collection of movies and TV shows. It's a bit sad they removed some of my favorite old school movies like 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'Sunset Boulevard'."
"I love this site, but there's not much that i really like on there. It's beacuse i'm very picky about the stuff i watch."
"Had an issue with my debit card not connecting to my account and after like 5 attempts, contacted live support. Jaynine/Jabnine some different spelling of the name was my assistant. I was already irritated as all hell, trying my best not to be out of my way rude (I was pretty blunt, but tried not to take out my frustration on her throughout the convo. I just wanted a solution). She wasn't terribly knowledgeable at all with the issue, or she didn't care to actually help me with the ACTUAL issue, not sure which one. I told her if I couldn't get this figured out I'd have to cancel as the account that's currently attached is a bank account I no longer have access to to deposit money into but will not be shutting down either. I did NOT want an overdraft fee. She apparently tried to charge the new card and told me it declined each time. I asked her if I were to try later today, tomorrow, next week, whatever, maybe there's a chance it'd work? Just a glitch in the moment? She replied by telling me it was rejecting the card because that specific card didn't accept recurring payments... I told her that's really strange because I have several auto pays connected to that card already. She essentially gave up and started suggesting other options for me like buying a gift card (I live out in BFE, it's not exactly the easiest for me to go and get one. I'm lucky to even get to my bank). I explained how this was an issue for me and she pretty much told me that's all she's got.I remember even just a few years ago, if you had issues like these, they'd either offer helpful advice, try a few different things as a fix, or work with you for some sort of solution and try to keep you as a customer even if it seems all else fails, not just intentionally let a customer go due to THEIR technical difficulties. There were no other attempts at a solution. I called my bank and they called BS on it as well, said it is absolutely allowed and there are no restrictions placed on my account. They have MANY clients who use their services for Netflix payments. As a several year customer of Netflix I am extremely disappointed. This is the first time I've contacted their support in a long time and to find they've changed THIS much... This is the new 2018 customer service care apparently. At least I have free Hulu, so cancelling might not be so bitter after all."
"Excellent service. The only downside is there seems to be quantity over quality on the Australian Netflix."
"Netflix is what awaits me every night after work. Hope to have someone beside me to binge watching. **wishful thinking"
"Best quality movies and TV series. Having a great rest while watching Netflix."
"Excellent but could use more content in Cyprus region!"
"A leader in streaming content. Netflix Originals are changing the game. Netflix is steadily gaining clout in the film industry. They continue to evolve and push the industry forward. Frankly, I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre reading this review. Check out some of Netflix‚Äôs content and find out for yourself. I suggest:Stranger ThingsOzarkOkjaSmall CrimesThose should get you hooked."
"Netflix is the best. Especially there netflix orignals they are so addictive and I binge watch Netflix all the time.Currently I am paying ¬£9.99 a month for 4K HDR shows plus my whole family can enjoy it with meGreat service and reliable"
"Great service, easy to leave if you decide to (when going travelling for a few months), unlike sky. And very easy to come back tom.great service. And great selection. Loving the variety of the originals too."
"Rubbish customer service. I was not able to watch Netflix over one month and after holiday decided to call them again to check why I am not able to sign in. Apparently someone hacked into my account and sign me out. I have called them 3 weeks ago and they could not detect it. When I suggested them that maybe somebody hacked into my account then they realized that was the issue. Obviously no refund and even no appologies. There is no even a complaints department where you can leave your feedback. I got also Amazon Prime and they have a way better customer service department than Netflix!"
"its great but sometimes it comes up with errors over and over again when i am trying to watch a movie"
"Trying very hard to contain myself with this review. My sentiments for Netflix are not very healthy for someone my age. I can't imagine,now, how life would be minus Netflix.Incredibly entertaining content at very low cost."
"netflix is definetlly the only thing you need when you are sick at home!"
"Gotta love Netflix for variety, but they're let down by the clunkly interface on the Roku - sort it out!"
"I've got nothing but positive feelings toward the Netflix product (and I suppose by association the company itself). Excellent content, especially the original content. I would appreciate a premium product offering higher quality streaming content. But I believe at this point the price is more than fair for what I am receiving.It's interesting that reviews of Netflix tend toward loving it or hating it. Perhaps the haters just don't have a sufficiently fast internet connection? I'm presently getting about 60 Mbps, but when I'v been below 10 it's not been the same experience. Netflix recommends 5Mbps for HD, but I'd say 20+ is really where the problems start to go away. Below 20Mbps, I'd say caveat emptor!"
"Netflix Originals are the best! I love Netflix - their originals are some of the best TV/Film productions around and I enjoy seeing their new material. I have never had an issue loading shows/films, and the quality has always been fantastic. Its also great being able to watch across TV, Mobile, Ipad and Laptop. My only complaint is that I wish some TV shows had complete seasons, instead of only offering 1 season out of 3. or 4 out of 5. Bit irritating!"
"I absolutely love Netfix. I remember when I first signed years ago, it was full of old movies and dramas we had seen before. But wow, how they have evolved over the years! Their dramas and movies are top quality, really brilliant. I bought a firestick so I can watch it on my TV. We pay extra for the family package and my daughter can watch on her laptop as she stays in Uni. Highly recommended."
"Netflix started this annoying feature of interrupting what I am watching and asking me if I am still watching.Last time I checked, I am paying for full time viewing, not an interrupted, part time.Their customer service will do absolutely nothing to correct this!"
"I love Netflix, it is fairly inexpensive, and has great shows!"
"I really like Netflix its a great service. I really find it easy to use and a great way to find new tv shows etc. Easy to use on my tablet . I hardly watch TV now I prefer catch ups or Netflix."
"since netflix have been messing with updates etc its been nothing but trouble downloading anything. i will be cancelling netflix today as its a waste of money since it no longer works.MY ADVICE GO ELSWHERE!! NETFLIX DOWNLOADS IS USELESS"
"Amazing shows, it makes up full time of my viewing. Best quality and content around!"
"I think Netflix is completely crap, I honestly can‚Äôt believe their still in business. Videos are slow and lag, videos keep crashing all of the time and then take 30-45 minutes to get up and running again, they don‚Äôt have any of the latest movies or tv shows, everything is from years ago. They don‚Äôt even have some of the popular tv shows such as csi or criminal minds which is just ridiculous considering how popular they are. I think they really need to rethink their business."
"Had an issue with my subscription but they were quick to resolve!Keep up the good work!"
"I really like Netflix its a great service.  I really find it easy to use and a great way to find new tv shows etc.     Easy to use and works on my TV and tablet perfectly.  I hardly watch TV now I prefer catch ups or Netflix."
"I‚Äôm so addicted to nexflix probably watching more of this than any other channel great selection of films and box sets to watch."
"Brilliant shows, it makes up 90% of my viewing. I find the Netflix primal programs are some of the best quality and content around"
"Today, 8 May 2018, Netflix does not work and no any info is given to the customers to be away why. Also most of the films are very old, We pay lots for so small. I wish something positive most be done."
"I just find Netlix quite hard to find what I am looking for (on all interfaces) and the films are generally not very exciting. But documentaries and dramas are great!!"
"No need for tv anymore. Just everything at your fingertipes. Excellent service!"
"Ok, I paid into Netflix about 6/7 months ago and my frustration with this service, is watching shows that have Seasons and there is no information on when or if another season will occur! And, some of the shows do not even have a final episode and you are left hanging! Just binge watched American Odysey and couldn't find a Season 2! Another one is The Colony l! Another Queen of the South, another The 100, Bloodline, House of Cards ( waiting...),  yo name a few! I am considering going to Firestick with Amazon as this gets very frustrating with Netflix!! An unhappy subscriber!"
"Not enough updates. And some of the movies are censored. Not great for a paying service."
"Gamechanger. I got rid of cable tv and have not looked back. Way cheaper and I can enjoy it on tv with no ads"
"I love netflix! We dont have cable because we have netflix. Netflix is has been coming out with lots of cool movies and shows. I love that I dont have to wait each week to watch a new show. When Netflix releases a show, they releases the full season. How awesome is that? $7.99/month and it can be on 2 devices!"
"I have called Netflix a couple of times to complain that they put movies that are not in English and they should list a foreign language category.  I waste time thinking I may want to watch a movie and when I go to get more info on the movie I then see it is not English as all the actors and Director are foreign,  As a result I waste time.  Most of the movies that are streamed are lousy and consist of dozens of ""Bollywood""  movies.  I suggested that they definitely list the movies there are not in English under a separate  heading and pass that on to management.  I was told they would not do that and if I was unhappy with a movie I should rate it.  How stupid and for me to list a rating for the dozens of movies I am not going to watch is idiotic."
"I have had Netflix for months and I pay 10.99 a month.i called them for the second time to let them know that I have watched every thriller and scary and drama movies that they have.i asked them when will they put new movies ( that is in english) out because lately they have been putting movies out that is not in English.they guy told me that he don't know what to say to me and I asked him can you tell me the last movies they put out he said I don't have that information.this company suck!@@@ I don't know what I am paying for"
"I love Netflix, but I HATE the fact that shows just start to play when I'm surfing. It's pushy and obnoxious and I wish like hell they'd stop it. Most of the original stuff is good, although quality has started to slip some. Looking sorta like Cinemax on a Tuesday at 2 am back in the day quality wise. All in all, it's incredible and I've found many terrific shows there."
"Sometimes get an error saying the service is unreachable but simply going back and pressing play again works. Other than that, never had any problems with buffering etc."
"My favourite app for tv-shows! I am totally addicted to Netflix and not afraid to show it :) Thank you guys for you are the reason I can finally stay home without getting bored!!! The app is amazing, I use in on my smart-tv, smartphone, ps4.. you name it!!!! Love it, I hope we get more new shows ... still waiting for the last season of Reign... please make it happen soon <3"
"We use it for every show and movie. I'm really not sure why i have cable."
"Glad that they keep adding new shows and movies, though the price could be a little lower"
"I love netflix, need more movies, but they are great. I definitely recommend Netflix."
"Absolute rubbish cannot connect would have given 0 stars of able"
"Great service, good selection of movies and shows!"
"When I first purchased Netflix I purchased it with a number of programmes in mind that I wanted to watch. The problem I had, is that even though many of the programmes I had in mind were fairly well known and liked, none of them were available on Netflix.However, I've since started using Netflix in a different way and I now look at the programmes that are available and watch ones which might appeal to me. Since I've used it this way have discovered a number of really good series that I would never have watched if they hadn't been on Netflix. One other frustration I have with them is that they sometimes don't have all of the series of a programme available, which makes very little sense to me - it's frustrating when you've really got into a series with 6 seasons only to find Netflix has Seasons 1-5.Whether it's worth the value is really a matter of how much you watch it, but given there are so many programmes available, I think what they charge is probably fair.Overall, it's a good service at a fair price - I'd recommend."
"always impressed with the new box sets and is really good value for money"
"It has quite a selection of films and TV shows which keep me busy.The problem that I have is that every month they cut the old stuff and bring in the new stuff. Sometimes you want to watch the old stuff again.But other than that I'm happy with what I have."
"Great new shows recently. Keep it up"
"works great for me, can find all my favorite shows here"
"Absolutely AceGreat customer support, and great movie choices.Don't change a thing."
"For customer service, I award this. Assistance was prompt and effective in a situation I expected to be hard to explain and to resolve."
"love all of the available content, I watch my favorite shows and movies through Netflix"
"Went on to our smart TV to sign up for the ¬£7.99 plan. When we got to payment the system had taken it to the ¬£9.99 plan. We were unable to get the system to change the plan even though there was an option on the screen to do this. Seems like a bit of a con to me so didn't complete!"
"Netflix has a huge library of movies and TV shows. True, there are many programs you‚Äôd expect to be available but aren‚Äôt (and others that disappear without any apparent notice) but this is more than made up by the Netflix originals: Manhunter, Star Trek Discovery, Altered Carbon, Daredevil and, of course, Stranger Things, to name just a few of my favourites. Astonishing."
"I wish Netflix was better than it is. I hate their main screen where you choose the movies or programs you want to watch. It's user experience and design sucks and is frustrating. They do have excellent programing I have to admit, but get a better design to make it easier to navigate!"
"Terrible customer service experience who were meant to help!!!! Rude staff!! I am contacting you in order to express my concerns and to raise a formal complaint as I have not received a response to my original complaint from March 2nd, 2018 when phoning you.To explain in more detail I complained about the fact that a series I started to watch on Netflix ... Vikings suddenly disappeared. There was not prior warning of this and no indication this would occur.On contacting Netflix they were completely unhelpful. They couldn't care less and just explained their license expired and I can see it's going to expire. I have no info that this would expire. When complained this was not good enough and what they were going to do to compensate me they say they will do nothing. I said this is not the level of customer service I expect and I have been a long term customer and this is not expected service level. If this is how Netflix are going treat customers I'll just cancel my account.To this she couldn't care less.I asked to pass me through to a manager. She refused and eventually said she would. Left me on hold for over 10 mins imho was simply hoping I hung up!!!!On finally answering again she was about to make more excuses and fob me off once again! I asked her to give me some simple answers 1. Why she left me on hold for so long?!2. Is she going to pass me onto a manager or not?3. Wanted to ask what compensation would be provided?! But she had the nerve to accuse me of being rude to her and just hung up!!!!If this is the sort of service Netflix want to provide customers then you can go to hell!The call lasted 16mins or so in total and I've attached a screen shot. She accessed my account as she's asked for me email id. the caller ended at 2007 GMT 2/3/18.You should be able to pull her records and the call from this!Ofcourse I'm extremely angered at A) being fobbed off from the start by unhelpful staff B). No show that I was expecting C) ignorant stuck up rude staff who couldn't give s damn about customer care D) not being passed to a manager, be given a call ref, or name. E) the complete nerve of netflix and your staff to think you are too big and too important to care for your customer or provide any decent service or care to operate customers!  I wouldn't be phoning you up if everything was fine would I?! What are you going to do to resolve this if anything?If this is not resolved quickly I want it ESCALATed within 2 week max! If it is still not resolved I'll be cancelling my account, I'll also be writing to watchdog, ofcom, and all over social media about my experiences of Netflix and ensuring everyone I know on Netflix deletes their accounts, many of whom for family I've signed up!!!Thanks for nothing!To resolve this issue I would like you to See my long note in the first section!I want the call handler reprimanded I want compensation!.I consider this a very serious issue which has caused me an unnecessary amount of aggravation."
"Black Mirror Episodes 3 and 4 are worth the subscription alone."
"Best streaming app in the World. Great variety in the quality of movies and series."
"Happy with the content but appalled by the support. Very disappointed."
"Finally a place where I can watch all my tv shows"
"I have always enjoyed the wide range of show they have on netflix. They know how to keep their customers happy!"
"I can't find anythink i want to watch it's rubbish I would rather pay the extra money to sky and have extra box in my room, I had returned thinking it's got better and it hasn't, it's mostly old films and series or it's ones you have never heard of before. Its certainly not worth the money i woukdnt pay 2.50 a month for this. My now box was way better be cancelling this then going back to them."
"Really like Netflix and how intuitive it is, a lot of shows to choose from"
"The variety on Netflix is getting worse each month. The same films show under multiple catagories giving the illusion there are 1000‚Äôs to choose from. In reality there is a small number of films most of which have been knocking about since the 70‚Äôs and overall a really poor entertainment system for what they charge. There is an ever growing number of foreign films which annoyingly have English titles which means you spend even more time clicking in and out of the overviews before you can ascertain whether it is a film you can actually understand. Overall pisspoor choice, old outdated films and I‚Äôd guess a higher number of non-English speaking films than English. Sort it out Netflix - daylight robbery.  Subscription cancelled üëçüèº"
"It's really worth paying for. I used to think that is never pay for a service like this but it doesn't cost much and is worth every penny."
"Never thought I'd pay for this kind of service, but it's super convenient. Easy to use, no brainer"
"My account was unfortunately compromised,Obviously concerned I rang customer help to be told:""We're Netflix, what are we known for ... Streaming, not security""""Maybe we aren't as secure as we should be - it's quite easy to change someone's details""""We aren't the Pentagon - we don't do retina scans""""We've forwarded the details on to the authorites"" ... Which sounds great but when asked who the authorities are, the response ""I don't know - Scotland Yard?"" doesn't fill me with confidence...Overall I think after 40 minutes of painful, unhelpful, sarcastic comments, we did manage to change my account details together and chuck out Cristux the Spanish Hacker.Maybe be a bit more sympathetic to customers who've been hacked because of your lack of security in the future Netflix."
"Great that there's no adverts, love the t.v. series and films that are available but they don't update as much as I'd like"
"I personally think ¬£7.99 for Netflix on two devices is cheap and I‚Äôd happily pay ¬£10 or more. Fair enough sometimes it‚Äôs frustrating when you fancy a film and settle for something else because it‚Äôs not on there, but the choice is brilliant. After all, what‚Äôs better than Netflix and chill? üòâ"
"Thought i would try netflix Subscription then cancelled it... But they kept on taking the money anyway!  I check my direct debits and standing orders regularly but the payment wasn't showing up there - netflix uses some kind of sneaky method of taking money out of your account."
"For a quiet night in. Or a slumber party on any mobile device"
"Keep an eye on your bank account! I cancelled after the the one month subscription but they took the money anyway. I called the customer assistance and they were incredibly rude, accused me of lying etc, just like the other reviews. By far and away the most appalling customer service I have received!!!"
"Website and apps work amazing and are so easy to use. Content could do with being updated more often rather than posting tv show seasons a year after they have been released on actual TV, this is the only reason i dropped a star. Overall netflix are still the Gods at binge watching and streaming."
"Netflix is the King of streaming. The only reason I don't give them a 5 Star review is because they don't maintain consistency in content across geographical regions. But they are the number 1, ahead of the other online giant"
"Over the pasted 6 months they have taken off so many good  films and movies and replaced them with rubbish. Netflix is No longer worth a penny! Never mind ¬£10PCM"
"Netflix customer service is shocking. Rang to advise that I had changed plan accidentally on an old account and now their was two payments being taken for my current account and the old one which I had obviously cancelled straight away. The lady continued to tell me that I had gone through a 4 click process to restart my old account when in fact all I had done was login to the old one by accident and click change plan, she continued to say in a very very accusing voice that I had in fact restarted my account and making me feel like I was lying. I do not ever expect to ring for assistance for a service I pay for every month to be made feel like I am lying. Now thanks to her accusing me of lying without saying I was lying all accounts with them ate cancelled. Her manners were atrocious and I'd never allow my colleagues to speak like that to a paying customer. Anyone recommend a new viewing site I'd be happy to take recommendations?"
"I love Netflix but i wish they would upload new stuff more often. And remove that bloody continue playing button which upsets me every time i get comfortable enough!"
"Good choice of videos and entertainment, use this every day, keep up the good work."
"i love netflix its cheap/ quality/superb just fantastic"
"In 2016 was bought Sony Bravia TV with Android. This TV is ‚ÄúNetflix ready device‚Äù with availability to access Netflix movies and TV shows streamed over the Internet. I was frustrated, I did not find movies of interest to me and decided to cancel my membership prior to the end of the free trial period. English is not my native language. I thought that I had found the option to cancel service from TV set. I tried two times to cancel the service but money from my bank's account was taken by Netflix.I could not get info from Netflix.com how I can do it. It is naive to think that from device ready to connection is also possible to cancel the service. I decided to breach the contract by blocked payments from my bank account.  Last month Bank`s Statement surprised me ‚Äì Netflix received payment. This becomes serious. I was starting to a serf on the internet looking for other experience and ways to get contact with Netflix staff.  I did it and I cancel my membership in a traditional way, my bill had every month increased for 8.99. Netflix staff spoke with me kindly, polite and after my story, I got minus payment for 3 months. Also was sent ‚ÄúNetflix terms of use‚Äù to make sure that I have no justice. I have got reading material.When I became a member of Netflix I red Terms of Use superficially and as a result of this, I missed information that breach of contract is possible only from My Account. Why can I not make the cancellation of service from the same device what was used for connection to it?Why there no other information on the Home page about the way to make cancellation in Netflix.com?Why Netflix did not breach the contract and continue to count the service charge more than the year if in Terms of Use I can read ‚Äúwe may suspend your access to the service until we have obtained valid Payment Method‚Äù?Why I have not received any invoice for this period if in Terms of Use I can read ‚Äúwe will send you information relating to your account (e.g. payment, authorizations, invoices, changes in password or Payment Method, confirmation messages, notices)in electronic form only, for example via emails to your email address provided during registration. ‚ÄùThe above suggests to me that this is not a customer friendly company.This is no matter how profits are gained, the main thing is profit."
"It's good but it doesn't work often for no reason. Love Netflix orginals"
"Customer service is very helpful & understand when I needed to close a old account which got hacked."
"Netflix charged my account even though they claim the first month is for free :("
"I acquired the monthly trial bundle for two screens a week ago and I've not been able to watch anything yet. The selection of products available doesn't show and the only film I managed to select wasn't showing with enough sound quality (images wouldn't match the voices).  I have wasted already a week of my free trial without being able to try your product."
"Bit pricey but the service is reliable and the selection of the movies and shows is amazing. It's definitely better than paying for tv!"
"Miguel was awesome he solved my problem in less than a minute! Love it!"
"Depending on the time of year Netflix offer a great variation of shows including documentaries, movies and series. I love binging on Netflix and it saved exactly where I am no matter where I access it from. Only thing is them putting their prices up every year. I have considered cancelling a few times because of this."
"Considering I used to brave the cold and wind to rent whichever  rubbish dvd was still left at the local rental shop I‚Äôm blown away by how easy it is to get access to so many titles . Only downside is that newer stuff is available on other sites , Netflix beats them for ease of use and Affordability  though"
"How did I live without Netflix? Great service at a great price. Have experienced their tech support on one occasion, it was friendly and helpful and resolved my issue. Excellent range of programmes always being updated. Email alerts recommending new series of things I have watched or new programmes I may enjoy are helpful and on target. No billing problems or technical issues after that first one. Have gotten serious value for money out of it but it's almost worth subscribing even if you only watch a couple of series or a few films. I think it's better for series and documentaries than films but this probably depends on taste. Have discovered some real gems via this service. Note: I use Firefox and it works like a dream. I had an issue using a different browser. I have used Netflix on my laptop and on my smartphone, both successfully. It stores where you get up to between devices accurately. I prefer the new style thumbs up/down ratings as simpler and seems to work better than the old style stars system."
"GreatI have decided to sign on with Netflix after a few app error, I called their customer service to found out the app was not compatible with my internet explorer ( e) but work great with google chrome Watching my favourite programme whenever and wherever.4 stars today!!!"
"One month free subscription seems too less."
"I've been a customer for many years.   I cancelled last month to save a little money and wanted to restart my subscription this month.   I signed in to the app and was given the option to renew by paying with Google Play.   I immediately got an error with the Netflix app even though the money was taken.   It told me to phone the customer service which I did via the app.  A horrendously rude and obnoxious person told me that it was nothing to do with Netflix and it was my fault for paying with Google Play.   I asked why this was an option for payment on the app if it didn't work.   The person just kept repeating the same line that it was nothing to do with them, they couldn't help and that I need to contact Google Play.   All i wanted was to know why they offered Google Play as a payment option if it didn't work,  so I asked to speak to someone who did know the answer and I was told to phone back myself.  I asked for the name of the person I was speaking to and they hung up on me.   DON'T EXPECT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM NETFLIX.    Also despite appearances you apparently CAN'T renew your membership via the app with Google Play.  I'm disgusted and won't be renewing. No one has the right to treat a customer so badly."
"One Word - Great!"
"Their content is top notch. Latests movies and TV series anytime I want to. Sure beats the rides I made to BlockBuster to rent and then deliver movies.Their price is more than cheap for what they offer and I even found some old movies of my childhood there that I totally had forgotten about.Only 4 starts because they accept PayPal and those guys stole from me."
"Don't know how I lived without it. I get so flustered when I watch TV now and I want to rewind and realize I can't :D People are so spoiled bc of netflix :D"
"Netflix is currently the superior streaming service. But one negative is the regional selection of content to feature. If only they could make all their online content available to all subscribers despite geographical location.But they are still the best"
"I live in Cambodia as a British Expat. Initially all went well. I have very patchy wifi where I live so I downloaded in the daytime, then watched offline in the evening.One night, I got home and all my downloads were missing. It said it couldn't connect to wifi (which I don't have really anyway). Next day I chatted to customer service and they said it's because the wifi was turned on and the service was trying to connect rather than being in the offline mode, so just turn off wifi when at home (on my tablet and all will be well). OK for about a week but it happened again. Next day I chatted online and was told that because I had crossed the border to Thailand for a few days, there were syncing issues. I explained that when it happens, I have no wifi at home so can't watch anything at all, nor chat to customer service. They said it definitely won't ever happen again, and gave me a regular number that they promised would be free to call even from Cambodia.Happened again, called the number, all of my phone credit was wiped out as it's charged full rate.Nowadays, it happens about once a week, all my downloads just disappear. Eventually it connects but the download buttons are missing, it's stream only and keeps skipping. Even when this isn't happening, often I successfully download something, watch it halfway through, suddenly the app gives me a message there's a problem with the download and it won't play any further. Download it again and the same thing, but no explanation. But there's nothing to do. No email to write to. Just chat, and the chat people say it's a sync issue, whatever that means. Maybe this works ok domestically in the US but my experience is that it is, to be generous, a beta service in Asia/traveling and not really suitable in it's current state. Great shame as I was loving it so much to start with. :("
"The overall quality of their catalogue (back- and new) is outstanding. Even Amazon Prime Video, with its excellent production, can't quite keep up for the time being. I remember when they only shipped DVDs, and they come a long way."
"I'm very satisfied with the offered variety, the quality and the variety of the provided services."
"Probably the best service I have for the money and value it brings."
"I would recommend Netflix for people after a wide range of films and television shows. I have found a lot to watch on Netflix and a good quality delivery experience on a range of devices. The video playback is easy to control with fast forward and rewind and extra features like subtitles and different audio languages more than on other video services. New and exclusive content is added daily and a range of subscription packages are available including Ultra HD and multiple screen access. I would recommend Netflix for range and delivery of content."
"Scandalous sales trickery, I chose not to continue with the service after the 6 weeks free trial ran out - turns out they've been taking my money ever since anywayI am sick of these morally dishonest tricks to con every last penny from customers. Netflix are 'The Reader's Digest' of the digital film world."
"Best value for money stream in the UK .Great films and tv series .Narcos a must ! A vast choice of thrillers ,drama, comedy and childrens toons and films all without ads sheer bliss !!"
"Definitely fun for the whole family. You can find fun for kids for adults and for both."
"Good price with good selection. Lots of great shows and some great movies too."
"We've got a 4-year-old son who loves Kids TV (which kid doesn't), but out of all the major service providers, Netflix comes out on top for its user interface. When we had Sky and Virgin Media my son couldn't control what TV he wanted, but having his own account on Netflix gave him that independence to choose what cartoons he wants. I'm knocking a star off the perfect five because their Rick and Morty series is a week behind (That's a show I watch, not recommended for kids)."
"If you are a fan of binging to TV shows, this place is definitely for you. I'm a kind of person afraid of getting 'addicted' to TV shows because I know I won't get any work don.I used the site to watch movies. But the same kept showing up in my suggested ones and I couldn't mark them as watched or anything. It was so annoying that I ended up cancelling my subscription in the end."
"I like netflix. For the montly subscription you can't go wrong. I usually spend some time going through it adding films or documentaries to my watchlist so that I always have something on hand to watch. The more I rate and watch something the more Netflix recommends for me. Overall, I like the service but know that America gets a far more superior choice of programmes and movies."
"Great movie selection for a fair price. I also love how you don't need to always go to a movie shop to buy a movie as chances are likely that Netflix has it! I would definitely recommend it"
"this company delivers all what we need...from work to my home..it gives us great bonding with my family....keep it up Netflix team...way to go!!!"
"The website is very easy to use, loads of great titles both their own and other titles. Prices are quite reasonable. One problem I had is that the suggestions etc. aren't always on point, or relative to what i watch. Another problem is that a lot of good titles aren't available in every country, which can be worked around but then you would have to watch without subtitles."
"Love them! Been a member for 2 years and the titles are getting better and better."
"Just cancelled this utterly rubbish service and would ask for refund of my monthly subscriptions but they deliberately make it impossible to contact them.Crappy choice of films and even when you stumble across something worth watching you get an error message saying something like oops something has gone wrong,try again later.Well no,I have got better things to do.Should rename the company Notflix!Complete waste of your time and money."
"Great for the price.. some crap films but also good original films and tv series to make up for it!"
"The cheapest way to watch favourite shows without spending a fortune. I kinda wish they were airing GoT, but I'm pretty sure they wont ever grab a license for that :("
"Hours of my life gone that I will never got back... but it was worth every minute!"
"i love them.  thanks to them i keep the family entertained and i dont pay a tv license.do with the UK had the american stuff though"
"As I've had the chance to try Netflix in different countries, I have to say that the content varies tremendously from country to country (aside from Netflix Originals) and in general it doesn't amount what you're paying for. In the US it is kinda of alright, in the UK way poorer in other countries even worst. Also, the content tends to be repeatable in different sections. In general I am talking about a 5 to 10+ fold when you compare the US that has like 1.5K TV shows and about 5K movies, to any other country. I think that Netflix has ended up being more like a fashion trend and knowing that, they stopped caring as much about quality."
"The movie selection is a bit thinner these days than I'd like but for the cost you really can't bet it. Use it more than my normal tv. Wish they has a super premium option. I'd happily pay double the fee if it meant they had a few more movies or big shows on it."
"My 1st experience with Netflix was a 30-day trial period. I was able to use the service as time permitted with no issues. Having received a $150 gift card at Christmas, I decided to open an account and become a regular user of the Netflix service. I attempted to watch movies, but for some odd reason, I could not connect to the service. After (3) days, I phoned Netflix's tech support for assistance. That turned out to be 2.50 hour call with no resolution. They tried to troubleshoot the problem but the final result was a verbal insult the agent didn't realize I could hear (when she thought the call was muted). That led to my request to cancel altogether.      The worse part of this is that Netflix refused to refund the $150. They say their policy prevents them from refunding gift cards. I didn't ask for another gift card,.. I just wanted them to refund me the $150 VALUE of the card.       I ended up filing a complaint with the Attorney General in my state. That took several months ... and it was a waste of time. I read reviews and discovered that tons of people are disgusted with Netflix as well. I only wish I had thought to read reviews before I decided to open the account.       It's AMAZING how little protection the consumer really has. We are just ""sitting ducks"" in the market place and the merchants - to a great extent - just don't give a crap! Netflix... BEWARE... you may have grown your customer base over the years... but it doesn't take long for you to lose your credibility. That day is surely coming.        ."
"Fair play. Exceptional customer service. Had an issue with Netflix saying password was incorrect. Called them up and Netflix answered on the second ring and talked me through rebooting fully with complete power off and then resent password and it worked. Excellent service."
"I love Netflix, it is fairly inexpensive, and has great shows!"
"I've watched everything good. Basically all the Netflix Originals are so bad Adam Sandler becomes a good actor."
"Great site, needs more good movies instead of garbage movies used to fill the site and make it look like they have a lot. I still have to resort to 3rd party sites to watch most everything I try to look for. But at least they keep full seasons/episodes and not only half shows like competitors."
"Having never had reason to speak to a person at Netflix I called them today and was really huffy as I thought they'd changed my service without my consent.  It turned out that the mistake was my end (my son changed it) but customer services were really good and even resolved the problem in my favour.  Plus, no automated systems - straight through to a human! It was so refreshing to speak to a customer service department which was fair and treated you as a valued customer.  Whilst the films on Netflix aren't great, the TV shows more than make up for it and there's something for everyone.  I would recommend."
"Unlike some early users and reviewers of Netflix I love the original programming and series content .I also like the fact that they have alot of BBC and ITV series to view so you can actually get the time to watch them when you may have missed episodes or not finished a series because they are removed too quickly from British telly on demand channels.I love the fact that they have a broad base of quality classic films , perfect for any film buff.Despite others views , I also believe they include alot of great new , international  and indie films, like The Lobster and great catalogue of documentary features, many on Art and more obscure topics , not available on other pay to views.I really do believe they get the balance right, the only reason it loses a star is that the British service doesn't get series collections as quickly as in the US.Please Netflix , if you read this , get the full collection of Peaky Blinders, Aquarius and Miss Fisher on in Blighty soon, and if the Stranger Things second series could be longer too, I'll give you 6 stars."
"Needs to be newer content as its kinda old"
"They appear to have removed any 'decent' films and replaced with own brand series and a handful of current hollywood trivia.  Has amazon taken the lead?"
"I had netflix for quite a few years. I am very happy with them & the price is too great."
"I dont just want to watch series!!!!Get me some movies that are not out of date!"
"The old, the new, the everything. Grateful for Netflix!"
"Its good service but i find the choice a little tight for certain genre of viewing materials."
"What a shame us expats (British people living outside the UK) don't have a special membership giving us access to the British Netflix network.  Most of the programmes I love are only available when I go to the UK.  Despite suggesting them, they never give me feedback or say why, as a British subject, I am not allowed access to the UK website.  Come on Netflix, give the Brits a chance!"
"They have a pretty good range of movies and TV Shows (especially the TV Shows). The only reason I have not given them a 5 starts is that they do not update new films that often. I have amazon prime as well which I would rate 4 stars as well (they are just as good as each other)"
"What an idiotic move it has been to take away the review stars given honestly by people and replace it with films you recommend people watch.If I want to watch a film at the cinema I will check out the reviews, if I was to buy something I will checkout reviews first. MASSIVE MISTAKE taking away this honesty from Netflix.  Now I have taken to googling reviews on films/programs to see if I wish to watch them. So disappointing."
"automatic renewal scammers that takes money out of your account  streams are slow and virus infected kasperslky blocked 30  viruses from netflix in  a hour avoid"
"For ¬£8 a month you can't get better really, lots of original content and unlike the other AMZ Video it is all free to watch.  Streaming quality if always excellent too!"
"There's plenty of good stuff on there giving good value for money. The box sets on offer are better then the selection of films, as you don't see too many of the big recent films appearing on there. It syncs very well with different devices, always accurately remembering where you were up to with watching something. A couple of annoyances are: 1) on a TV it sometimes doesn't show your saved 'My List' anywhere (these happens every now and then); 2) there is a 'Continue Watching' section which usually includes loads of programs you have actually watched but didn't watch until the credits ended, so it wrongly thinks you haven't finished watching it."
"Seems like there's a lot less stuff in the UK, and a load of junk content. Some Netflix originals are amazing though."
"Some brilliant series are coming to Netflix!  I loved 3%, Returned, Between and Travellers.  Stranger Things is pretty good too.  Has some hilarious old comedies.  Short on new movies of any real quality, but I much prefer the series anyway.  Oh, I love being able to watch The Fresh Prince and most of Red Dwarf too!"
"I started a free trial under BT, BT messed up and ended it on my behalf without my say so. So a few months later I call and ask to reset up, guy on phone was great, gave me another month free. Instant, loving it, using it every night, Sky may soon be going."
"Really quick signup, loved the free trial and the original programming is really high budget!"
"I like Netflix and you can find some classics but new movies are lacking. Asap steaming quality isn't up to scratch anymore."
"Good range of films and TV programmes for the price. Have never had any trouble with streaming."
"The customer service is great. The ease in navigating the website is great.  I just wish they had a wider selection of movies and shows."
"Amazing selection of shows and films"
"My Netflix account has been cancelled earlier this year but I continue to be charged, pls advice urgentlyI tried your Customer Chat Service, but after I have seen a wait time of 1 minute for 1 hour, I gave up  .... actually I have tried several times."
"Perks: Of course, it's great if you find a 'must watch' TV series or a film ect. Cons: On the main page they will show random categories based on your viewings, and these random categories change everytime you log on. which can be rather frustrating if you happened to see something which peaks your interest but forget to 'save to list'.It also would be nice to be able to create more than one 'list' - ones you can personally name so you can organise the programmes yourself. I find netflix a very impersonal and clunky device."
"Why did I even think I can live without it? Some stuff are banned at other parts of the world, but I hope they will fix it soon. Waiting for that to give it a fifth star"
"As a mum of 3 teenagers, I had to find a system for watching TV and Films, other than Satellite TV, that is expensive. My friend told me about Netflix, whereby I could have multiple login accounts, for all mobile and console devices to watch TV & Films. I thought I would use the Free signup offer, and I was amazed at how much you can watch. My children absolutely love it, for box sets and there favourite shows, so this really did offer me a cheap solution.I would highly recommend Netflix to anyone, especially families who can not afford to pay over ¬£60 per month for Sat TV.Netflix is easy to use, cheap and above all very useful for families with a diverse array of tastes."
"A nice addition to your home entertainment options. A good mixture of things to watch, a few more up to date films on a regular basis would be good though. However, lots of box sets to watch, Gotham, Daredevil, House of Cards, Stranger Things.....Think I‚Äôll keep watching, thanks."
"Not many movies, and I wish TV shows aired quicker (I understand the reasoning behind delays, but I wish there was a way to find out when new shows (for example, the next season of Brooklyn 99) are to be released.  Otherwise, it is the most convenient way to binge watch media content :)  I haven't had a problem (yet)."
"for star trek. Dr Who its Brilliant but the choice of films is really poor.It feels much more focused on TV shows. Almost any film I search for ""films related to"" appears and they aren't even remotely linked."
"I signed up a couple of weeks ago and so far I like it. Very user-friendly, lots of shows to watch."
"Used it for half a year, wish that new dramas can be uploaded sooner."
"why tf did you remove season 1, 2 and 3 of Glee? that was the only reason why i had netflix fml smh"
"Now if only they could add Fraiser to my region!"
"Excellent video quality and availability. I also like the technical insights Netflix gives to developers like me. :)"
"Den d√•rligste hjemmeside at navigere i. Useri√∏st."
"I really like being able to watch all these films for free. Move over dvds! Nice service."
"I subscribed to Netflix because i wanted to watch House, just to discover it's not available in Finland. What the hell?! I pay even more than Americans per month(‚Ç¨ to $ ratio) and i have less shows!? Anyway, not recommended if you are outside of US. Just pirate stuff, I am sure they will earn more money that way. Or they can just not discriminate non US users."
"This service is very easy to use! I love how it personalizes it to fit your preferences and finds similarities to what you like!"
"Hello, I used Netflix several months in germany without problems on a 4k samsung tv with smart hub. Then after 7 months, some contents stopped and started reloading always at about half of the the movies/episodes i watched. Not all, but some. Now nearly every content shows the problem now for me (Narcos, Stranger Things, most movies).The problem cant be cause by my internet connection, got 100 Mbit/s connection and bigger downloads sometimes even run with 11 MB/s. The same time the problem occurs, i can watch the same content on my pc without problems.And the problem is outstanding systematic: The content stops somewhere after the half of it, reloads until 25 % and shows a subtitle of a scene some minutes (most times around 2 min) ago. And after restarting the content out of the main menu, it shows the exact scene of the wrong subtitle! And tata, the same problem occurs about 2 min, even if i scroll over the scene.It cost me over 3 hours of calls with the support hotline to make clear to them, that its definitly a problem of their app with the TV. I restarted and did everything as they told me (router, wifi, lan, smart hub reset, tv reset with the lost of the whole program list, thanks), and it changed nothing. After getting to that point that netflix accepted the fact, that the app is the problem, they wanted to inform their development team with a precise description. And what happend, NOTHING!Even my demand to reset my whole account on their database to get rid of a possible problem with timestamps (I'm working in the QM of a company that develops apps), the support refused, not possible.So people at netfilx, if you aren't able to maintain an app that is delivered with a smart-tv and not willing to react on clear problems on some devices with it, i'm no more willing to be a netflix client. And because of the time consuming support hotline hours without progess/results/feedback only one star."
"I am fond of viewing all hollywood movies. I bought the netflix account but it was very disappointing as the moive database is very small. I am not going to renew the subscription for sure."
"I have lost several months due to netflix incompetent team to solve my problems signing."
"If you want to watch 5 mins of a TV show to have the app disconnect constantly go for it.  Netflix will blame everyone but themselves.  ""Our engineers say it's your ISP"".  However, my Internet connection is close to 100Mbps, the router shows no errors in its logs, every other streaming service I use Amazon, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Google play all play fine during off peak and peak hours. It's only ever Netflix hanging at 25% or throwing up cryptic error codes that are undocumented.  When you call customer services they refuse to provide any documented logs or evidence that your ISP is at fault but continuously spout nonsense from their imaginary engineers."
"Netflix is definitely worth a few quid a month! However I do wish that they would have more recent films on. Overall though, good site to use for watching films."
"Absolutely love Netflix have had it for over a year and I carnt imagine not having it so many fantastic shows films and series well worth paying for great value would highly recommend as there really is something for everyone."
"Netflix would be a 5 star if the library was as good as the USAs but i love netflix and ive never had any problems otherwise."
"Love watching Netflix and binging on series but the recommendation engine could be better. I get annoyed when I see the same hundred or so movies recommended to me when I log in."
"Now, I'm a Danish national living in Istanbul, Turkey. In Denmark I had subscribed to Netflix through a couple of years, so when Netflix came to Turkey, I was thrilled‚Ä¶The price in Turkey is only about 3‚Ç¨ cheaper than the price in Denmark. But  as earnings are between 3 and 4 times lower, I thought it logic - though I still considered it expensive, as for the same price I could buy 3 film on Turkish iTunes store, where 1 on Denmark.OK - I signed up, only to find the content is lacking. Not many of the international acclaimed Netflix Originals are here‚Ä¶ the other day season 4 of house of cards came (in July 2016). Programmes like OITNB aren't here at all‚Ä¶ instead we have a huge load of Korean and a bunch of Spanish and Indian series and films.The first couple of months the subtitle option was either English or Arabic‚Ä¶ and still not Turkish on all programmes.If you ask me, Netflix in Turkey is a rip-off. Expensive an VERY MUCH lacking in shows & films.Why isn't Netflix the same all over?"
"And promotes piracy ... making sure you can not see content is now a key competence."
"I personally love it just NetFlix and child.Its not something with sex..."
"I signed up for the free trail yesterday  an today my netflix wudnt work i rang an they said its because i had it hooked up to my chrome cast because my telly is not a smart tv  !! Because my sisster had her own netflix acc  an she had it hooked up to the chrome cast aswell  bt her trail was over a few months  an i decied to get a acc  an now because we shared the chrome cast  mean im not entilted to a netflix acc  not fair  iv never had a acc before  only if pay for it   bt i wont  everyome eles is allowed a  free trail   an besides  i had it for one day an theres more upto date films on youtube  not really worth it"
"Netflix have a variety of children movies for their enjoyment."
"Netflix gives a month for free, I tried to cancel it because the movies I wanted to watch were not available and suddenly it was a charge on my account."
"Easy to use and cheap for the family!"
"Programing continues to get better all the time. I also like the fact that they offer adult and kids programming."
"I love Netflix: I use both the streaming on DVD services and have been relatively satisfied with both. My only complaint is that it is impossible to see ALL of the new titles that are available. I realize that they are trying to help, but their algorithm is only guessing at what you might like based on what you've already watched. Well,...  the problem with that is if a title I want isn't shown then I don't even KNOW that I could have watched it. I have to go to other websites every month in order to find out what they are actually going to be offering, and to know in advance what is going to be taken off. These websites aren't always accurate, but that's better than not knowing at all. Believe me, I've complained about this over and over and so far nothing has changed. And like others say, thanks to this practice, viewers are all too frequently presented with the same titles over and over--even titles that you've already watched (and rated) and THAT is annoying. Still, I find plenty to watch and am getting my money's worth. It's just that I shouldn't have to go to OTHER websites to find out which titles I want to watch."
"Ok lacks load of content but when you get this free with another service you can't complain it does have some exclusive shows with is a win win"
"I don't get it, why do people complain on things such as ""bad selection of shows"". Come on, everything is just a click away. Occasional problems are normal."
"I tend to use netflix most days to provide a variety of differnt film styles I have found the service to be very reliable (considering we live in a poor signal area) and we get no buffering issues I like the different styles and would suggest even more older files such as:  saturday Night fever , Midnight  Express (i think) Beats going toi the cinema and allows me to control my viewing habits Would like to see more and more films on the site and veyr happy to randomly select any type of film from 1950's to current day - even more choice please - very happy with the current service - what else is in the pipeline? - are you able to tell me ? :)"
"Not much to chose:Movies: 50% outdated blockbuster, 20% horrible B moveies, 20 % watctable movies... but you properly all ready seen them. Last 10% is BBC or Online documentaries of very little value. LIke Brittains great castles and the ""secrets of the pyramids""TV shows: This is just utterly crap, Not many TV shows and they have only 2-3 tv shows that are up to date, the rest they only have 1 or 2 seasons of tv show with several seasons"
"Good servide especially love the picture quality. Although would prefer if there were more titles and newer ones! Family Guy is a missing one üò≠"
"So I actually wanted to review the new proxy I found, Proxmate, which gets around the Netflix VPN ban and makes the site worthwhile again.However since Proxmate is not on Trustpilot I'll leave that review here instead and perhaps someone will find it useful. So yes, get Proxmate for $10 a year and Netflix works again.Also, in the event that anyone responsible for pressuring Netflix to enforce the ban finds this I'll say...You wanted VPNs banned to enforce international copyright laws and prevent 'illegal' viewing of content unlicensed or licensed elsewhere in some countries. As a result of doing this (before finding Proxmate) I simply went immediately back to just pirating the content (as I did before Netflix came along). All the efforts made by content creators, studios and producing companies to prevent piracy have made almost no difference to the levels of piracy. Netflix however gave everyone a cheap, easy and legal alternative and made far more of a dent in the piracy figures than anything else. Preventing people using VPNs is only going to force them back to piracy and undo all the good that Netflix has done to stop it...Oh and also whilst I am here (and since Netflix have stopped responding to my constant emails about this subject)... the new site design is utterly dreadful. It used to work perfectly and be very easy to browse and now... well half the time the play button just vanishes on me and the other half programs which I know full well are available don't appear in searches or have half the seasons missing. Seriously some films and shows only show up if you search the full title with capitalisation and others only show up if you don't search the full title and disappear the moment you type it out fully. It's bizarre.Why anyone at Netflix thought this change was sensible is beyond me."
"""To browse, users will click on an arrow, and five titles will slide into place‚Äîan animation meant to create the feel of a speedy interaction, Prasad says."" (in an article by Wired.com). It creates anything BUT a speedy interaction. I hate having to feel I'm walking trough syrup every time I enter the site. Give users OPTIONS - I for one NEED to be able to have a large grid to browse. It's simply inefficient having to browse, slowly, through a TON of content you've already seen. I'm glad I can keep signing up for free accounts, because this hasn't been worth paying for in years."
"I signed up because my Kids wanted to watch Mako Mermaids! At the start I thought I may as well sign up for the free months trial as they will have finished watching the series by then and I can cancel without charge.But.... I have to say for the ¬£8.99 monthly fee my whole family can watch (4 of us) at the same time, on any device.  Its so mobile, you can start watching on one device and pause and pick up the viewing on another.  It beats Sky Q any day! You can set up Child or Adult profiles and Netflx learns what you like and offers suggestions based on what you have watched already.The only niggles are that I'd like to be able to set up a profile based on age rating for programs, rather than child/adult so my elder daughter could watch some more grown up programs as I had to set her up with an adult profile and supervise her.Also it would be nice if Netflix could secure a few more recent series and I'd personally love to see Frasier, Everybody Loves Raymond, The Middle and According to Jim... those are great to re-watch over and over!But well done Netflix, keep up the good work I wont be leaving you anytime soon!"
"It¬¥s very user friendly. It remembers timecode positions in absolutely EVERY episode/movie you watch, so you can pick up where you left of in a movie last year.The swedish support is amazing! My mother accidentaly had an account which she never used. When she called the customer service to close the account, the woman on the phone said: But you never even used this account? To which my mother replied: Yeah I know. The customer support lady then replied that they where gonna pay back the money to my mother, for the nine month she had the account, without my mother even asking for it.Now thats great customer service!"
"Too bad Netflix did this. As a Dutch guy living in Germany I just want to see the Dutch titles. Will finish the two series that I actually can watch and will cancel my account most likely - not paying 9,99 euros for things I'm not looking for."
"I like Netflix, but the selection in Denmark is poor, this was no problem prior to Netflix' geo-block feature, since you could access another region by simply changing your VPN. Now however, you are stuck with whatever local movies netflix has picked to be available in your region. I consider unsubscribing from the service, as it is no longer worth the 142.00 USD we annually pay for the service outside of the US.I sincerely hope they add a new feature to set which profiles are allowed to access content in other regions. Until then, I cannot recommend having a subscription to the service."
"The selection of films and series is far below par and since Netflix disallowed the use of a VPN, it doesn't merit the fee. Despite saying on the chat that they are working to overcome this problem, it's not enough to keep me as a customer."
"I live in Canada & I cut the cord on my cable TV  & went to Netflix. I was using a VPN to access the USA version of Netflix mostly because the Canadian version sucks.Even the American version the TV shows are 3-4 years out of date & same goes for movies & docs. Since they started blocking users from outside the US I have cancelled my Netflix subscription & started using Kodi.Best move I ever made, a lot more content, all up to date & it's free.Goodbye Netflix"
"I have used Netflix for years, absolutely excellent service. They are constantly adding new and exciting programs and films.As I have been with Netflix for so long, my monthly price was frozen and attributed to loyalty to the brand. I wish this was more common place in the modern world, but sadly its a rarity. Very much appreciated, I have and will continue to recommend the brand to friends and family."
"Love the shows.  Better Call Saul is brilliant and had to watch it after blu rays of Breaking Bad...  Customer service is faultless when I've had to call.  A model many other companies should look at.All I ask for is more UHD / 4K content.  That is a bit slim.  I know it's an emerging technology, but I still crave more good stuff here, and more films too (ideally in 7.1)"
"Says it all really, a time drain but a fun one."
"Good quality,service,Thanks"
"I am from the US living in a foreign country. I am now retired having sold my company that I owed and operated solely in the country that I am still living in and was using a VPN to receive Netflix  programming from the United States. When Netflix made the decision to block all VPNs I personally as well as several others I know were personally affected. The problem that this has caused is that my hearing is very poor and getting worse as time goes on and the country I live in does not offer English subtitles with very little of their Netflix offerings. Having invested almost all the money from the sale of my company into a home and the property for it my wife and I are living on a very limited income and Netflix was one of the few luxuries we afforded ourselves. I know you're all thinking why don't I just get a hearing aid but number one, is the money issue and number two, I have tried several different models and I still, even with the use of a hearing aid, have a problem understanding a lot of spoken words. Consequently I have already canceled my Netflix subscription and will not be renewing it until this issue is resolved. I also have several friends that were using the English subtitles to help them learn English. I am currently searching for other alternatives among which is Amazon prime which seems to have a great programming lineup and a lot of other benefits and a slightly cheaper price when purchasing a year subscription and so far is not blocking any VPNs that I know of. I believe that by taking this stance Netflix has not taken the old, poor, and nearly deaf into account and in doing this is showing that they are clearly prejudiced against the old, handicapped, and financially limited and could by some seen to be racist as well. I read recently that Netflix has a net worth of approximately 30 billion dollars so I am sure that the rantings of one poor old jerk living in a foreign country means little to them but I say never underestimate the power of one person. Just ask your CEO, Wilmot Reed Hastings, Jr."
"I stopped warching regular TV"
"I love Netflix! I've been a fan for a while, using some friend's and family members accounts over the years. I finally joined Netflix and opened my own account with them this month, January. It's pretty cool that the first month is free! I have the premium HD account for $11.99 a month. My boyfriend and I split the cost each month and have been enjoying endless shows and movies while my 3-year-old daughter enjoys her child friendly account, which Netflix allows me to label as a ""Kid"" account to basically filter her shows. Great quality, variety, and very affordable. I'm a big fan and highly recommend it!"
"I can't stop watching!"
"I have to say that I am a satisfied customer of NETFLIX. The UHD and HD quality is always of highest quality and never freezing problems as there are with other Video Streaming companies. Also I had a Credit Card expire a few months ago and I hadn¬¥t got the replacement one so they ceased my service BUT a quick chat with an online customer service guy and he gave me two weeks to solve my problem and reconnected me instantly. When I entered my new card details they didn¬¥t even charge me for the two weeks. Love the programming too not just the movies, excellent Series, Kids stuff and just about anything. Many companies lack customer service but not the case with Netflix, KEEP IT UP"
"Great idea! I like Narcos and more.. :-)"
"Great service, huge selection in the US, need to push the catalog quite a bit in Spain the next few months. PS. I have my broadband with Vodafone, so no access issues, unlike with Telefonica :-)"
"Like many I got fed up with freeview, and my BT TV packages so I looked at Netflix and other streaming services etcI opted for Netflix, really easy to set up, HD, great titles etc. And it is 'Amazing at first', because it's all new and there's loads to get into. But a couple of months in and I'm searching for something new to watch etc. The kids absolutely love it, so we'll be keeping it. It's easy to set up different user profiles so you can make sure your children are only watching age appropriate telly, and there are loads of classic, quality box sets of series and tv programs to enjoy but you'll have to wait for new releases....which is to be expected.I still find myself spending more time watching Netflix then Freeview so I would recommend it. The first month was completely free and although I didn't cancel apparently it's a case of clicking a button if you want to, so why not have a month of free Netflix?"
"Yes, Netflix is a great idea and all that, I wholeheartedly agree. My problem is that when I signed up for a free one-month trial and cancelled a month later, I was charged for 2 months' worth of viewing - for one month of something that should have been free. I chatted with them on their live chat and spoke to two people whose first language was definitely not English. Both were also pretty unprofessional to the point where I was worried I had signed up to a fake version of Netflix. Comments like ""Yaaay you're back online, so I don't have to close this chat!"" and ""I am so glad that you are chatting into me today"" didn't fill me with confidence. Apparently, the reason for the charges was that Netflix detected that the household I used it in had been used previously for a free trial. But, I'm pretty sure that Netflix has the technology to figure out if the device is using the free trial, not the household. Regardless, I received no emails, no contact to tell me that they suspected this had happened. Instead they decided to charge me on the sly. POOR SERVICE!"
"Since i get netflix, Liam an happy man"
"I have been enjoying Netlix's huge offer of documentaries for quite a while now. Still haven't had the time to check everything I wanted but that's what weekends are for! The other thing I love about this is the fact that it remembers when you paused something so you don't have to go through hassle next time you log in! Perfect!"
"You'll definitely won't regret paying few bucks to watch whatever your heart desires. Anywhere, anytime. Just love it!"
"I love Netflix. BUT, not the DVD membership. Why? IT'S SLOW!!!!!!! Worse than a turtle!!!!! I have called customer service few times, you know, let's all blame the UPS!!!! Right? Netflix says ups is slow, and they cannot have a different system because of the amount of deliver they have to do everyday! Really? Have you ever heard about Amazon prime????? Fast, awesome, incredible!?!? Then, you tell me there is no other way to deliver the DVDs???? Maybe how about training the ups guys a little more regarding the SCANNING MACHINE??????? I don't believe they know what that machine is supposed to do, or if they do, they don't scan DVDs... Well, this is here in California. Because, back home in Indiana, things were much better when it comes to the dvd deliver... So fast!!!! Maybe Californian ups guys aren't well trained? I don't care! I just know I pay more for DVDs, and I want it at my place, FAST! Otherwise it will be like, hello season 1, after 2 months hello season 1.1!!!! Please! A company this big cannot deliver this bad, bad service."
"Love the app on my phone, but wish there was a bit more choice of films."
"At this point I am so afraid I won't be able to live without a Netflix that I would be ready to pay a pretty large monthly fee just to keep it. Boy, is the life without commercials refreshing or what?"
"Cable price is outrageous the only thing I would change is that sometimes video quality is poor and sometimes the video just stops but its rare and overall still better than paying 80 -90 dollars for a few cable stations"
"Netflix is a great company that revolutionized entertainment with their DVD delivery service. I love that part of the company. Their streaming service works very well, but the selection of entertainment is still limited. If you really want to see all the great shows and movies, you must have both the DVD and Streaming services.My main complaint with Netflix is the redesign they did to their website which provides me with less information about ratings and increased difficulty in finding what I want to find. This seems to happen a lot whereby a company 'upgrades' their App or website and the upgrade is far worse than the prior version.But, all in all, Netflix is awesome."
"I just enjoy a great variety of program without commercials. It's so refreshing and it also doesn't waste your time like a regular TV program does."
"Netflix is great and terrible. Great way to get easy entertainment. Terrible that once I got streaming I get nothing done! I've watched the complete star trek series ---- they have EVERY SINGLE STAR TREK SHOW ON STREAMING. That alone is worth the price of admission."
"I've enjoyed Netflix for a year now. No problems. I would recommend them to anyone."
"The Uk netflix is really, really poor. However the american version is bursting with content, tv, film and my favourite - documentaries.It would seem the only way to get around this is via proxy or by actually living in the USA. I know this is down to licensing etc on their content, but c'mon Netflix, the UK have had the same content for too long... ie, years!"
"Always been really happy with Netflix. There's so much to choose from. Recently I had a problem (not Netflix's fault) but they were so helpful and helped me resolve the issue quickly"
"Netflix is just perfect. You pay a reasonable price per month and you get great deal of movies / series / documentaries, and more. I have no problems streaming on my android devices or laptop. It's always updated to improve the user experience and it has a great user interface. I'd recommend everyone to try at least the 1st free month and see for yourself."
"I have been with them for near Two years and never had a problem.Very good Boxsets and Movies, often bringing  new releases asap.Its a pity the BBC can't adopt such value for money. I would suggestmaking Netflix your main site for TV. It even runs on my tablet whenin the spare room or out side. no fuss value for money service 5*s"
"Title says it all - Netflix is awesome! There is something for everyone in the family - both the kids and myself and the hubby!"
"If you're on the DVD rental, the price is reasonable, but NF appears to be phasing this out, as titles are becoming limited - they have removed many that used to be available, especially TV series.  Not sure if the same thing is happening with streaming.  Apparently NO ONE monitors their consumer reviews at the website - pages and pages will be filled up with complaints about not having enough seasons of a series available or demanding streaming, rather than actually reviewing the show itself.  I have no idea why people think NF personnel are visiting the review pages, but I wish they'd hire someone to delete these non-reviews!  I will say customer service has always been friendly and helpful about various issues."
"My family have been using Netflix now for about a year and find their service 100% reliable and a wide selection of stuff for ages from 11 to 57 and 4 between.  However, it is annoying that Grimm Season 4 isn't on their yet."
"Very reliable web based video streaming service with consistent quality and enjoyable content."
"I signed up for Netflix and went with the plan that has 4K. So far I am not to impressed with their catalog but the service seems decent and haven't had any major issues. Hopefully they will expand it more so I can enjoy it with the family."
"Where to begin.. Let's list the positive at least.. Customer service seems like they genuinely want to help.. Although they are unable to solve any problems, they still take their time to listen and go through the motions. That is nice at least.The rest of this so-called movie-service is just.. sigh.. well my one star speaks for itself.Selection is weak, and how come you have to change country all the time to watch the various movies and shows? doesn't everybody pay the same fee?Oh and don't even get me started on the ongoing problems with compatibility with chrome cast.. My device streams video files and youtube perfectly, but when it comes to netflix is becomes utterly useless.. Something that can only be caused by techincal problems on the netflix side. This is also supported on various forums by the way.."
"sometimes its a little slow, but it is an easy website that can allow you to watch tv shows, and movies. but the thing i dont like about it is that there are kinda old movies that had a 5 or 4 star rating and netflix does not have that movie. [like bogus one of my favorite movies] if netflix fixes this problem i will give a five star rating"
"However, if you remove the possibility of accessing  the American servers, I will stop subscribing to Netflix. Only the American servers contain sufficient amounts of titles."
"Got my Netflix at Christmas and it's pure mint! Major choice of movies and TV and at ¬£7.00 yer can't go wrong!"
"Great service on the webchat by Calvin. cheerful and friendly on a Saturday morning. Had a problem with being charged for the free trail. He refunded straight away. couldn't ask for more. 5*"
"Netflix has an amazing selection of shows. I watch everyday on Netflix what I want, do not have cable thanks to Netflix."
"I purchased Netflix a month ago and always watching shows when I come home. I absolutely love Netflix, very happy with the shows and movies it has."
"Netflix is simply the best streaming site in the world. Well worth the subscription cost."
"And still the best. Nothing compares to netflix."
"I like the movie selections and the customer service. The movies i stream never buffer. Overall great experience"
"I used to have Dish Network Cable and paid around $80 a month.  I had to downsize due to financial reasons and found Netflix.  I've never been happier! It's a cheaper alternative to cable.  There are plenty of shows/movies/documentaries to watch.  I haven't run out yet.  The selections are great.  You have to wait awhile for anything that is new to go on Netflix but that isn't a problem for me, especially for that price.  If you can't afford cable and can wait, Netflix is just as good!"
"The service is brilliant, but compared to the american version we here in england hardly get anything, half of the series' are missing which means you can watch 1 and 2 but to watch the 3rd or 4th series you have to go elsewhere to find it. Seriously need to update your library netflix!"
"They could use them more content. House of cards is great!"
"I think Netflix is better than paying for Cable. While I don't like their streaming and renting model (I feel like it's a bit greedy), I do understand their position on why. Lots of selection, I often get the new rental releases fairly early (but I'm pretty diligent on my queue which takes a little work) and their customer service has always tried to work out issues with me which I appreciate. Overall really good, I just wish there were more competitors to Netflix :-("
"It's quite affordable and plenty of good stuff to watch."
"I have experience few problems with Netflix on my XBOX 360 and on my laptop. On the odd occasion I have had to contact customer services, I was met with friendly, polite conversation that felt closer to a chat with a friend more than technical support.Following a quick fix, the phone operative and myself continued to talk for some time about our favourite films and shows. Honestly, a 5 star service.Operative name: Jhordain. An absolute diamond!"
"My credit card that I was using for this account was deactivated. They kept asking me to update my billing info. I did not want this service any longer so I did nothing. I finally got my new credit card issued after the old one was stolen. Netflix somehow entered my new credit card information on my account without me giving it to them and started charging it. How did they get the new Visa information? They will not reply to me. They stole my information and charged my new card without authorization. I am filing charges against Netflix."
"Netflix is filled with great TV shows and movies and they are always uploading more and more everyday. For what you pay, you really do get a lot of choice. Would definitely recommend."
"The main reason Netflix gets 5/5, is for uploading the Breaking Bad season 5  episodes just hours after they were live in the US. Could do with adding some more recent movies more often, however there are some great films that get added now and then. Definitely worth the money!"
"I was quite reluctant to start paying for an online streaming service as I had heard that the catalogue on Netflix etc could be quite limited in terms of options. I couldn't be happier with the service, I hardly ever watch normal telly anymore and there's loads of series from America that the family have gotten into now, never had any real problems with connectivity either!"
"Very happy with the product and the price!  Many nights of entertainment for such a small monthly fee."
"So much better value than Sky and easy to start and cancel whenever you want without this wouldn't bother"
"I only use Netflix now for TV, At ¬£72 a year and only paying for shows i want to watch it is a great service. I recommend it to everyone."
"I hardly even watch tv anymore when all my series are on Netflix couldn't live without it"
"I use netflix on a daily basis, because I am a huge fan of movies and it never lets me down. I had several technical issues but other than that I love the website."
"I went on chat with customer services to complain that plot summaries on the tv series (The Good Wife) I was watching contained glaring spoilers.  This was incredibly frustrating and detracted very much from my enjoyment of the series.Here is the greeting I got from the agent:""Hi! This is Xxxxx, your Netflix fairy godmother. What wish may I grant you today?""Perhaps they thought this was funny or endearing but I found it a complete turn off.  There then followed various false and insincere phrases about how they had ""the pleasure of talking to me"" and how it was ""great to meet you"".  Ugh!Netflix, it turns out, has no email address to send your complaints about customer service to so no marks from me on that score.  Chat was incredibly slow and a waste of time."
"not many newer films,but a decent selection of older 1's...prefer it for things like hemlock grove ,a very good netflix original,and other box sets..if like me u didnt catch things like breaking bad,american horror,24 etc 1st time around ,then the value for money is excellent..wish they would get more films and series like game of thrones ,spartacus etc..worth the 4 stars for price"
"Joined Netflix thinking it would be great to have a bigger selection of films/TV etc to watch, disappointed - most people will already have the DVD of the films as they are so old, the TV selection are again old series, nothing new or exciting here, waste of money !"
"I can watch films anywhere on any device - it's great."
"Samsung TV App is REALLY hard to navigate and there are too many lame suggestions for movies that I wouldn't watch unless I was tied to a chair in front of my TV with my eyelids sellotaped open.Why no simple search by genre?I don't know who decides what movies to add to the vault, but whoever it is, they suck. I've cancelled my subscription and won't be renewing."
"Netflix is brilliant for me and perfect that you can restrict access for the kids. I have always had brilliant service from Netflix! The very few times I have contacted customer service they have been on the ball. Tonight I spoke to a lady (Katya) on the Live Chat team and she was brilliant, extremely friendly and definitely made me feel a valued customer. With 1000's of hours of TV shows and movies where else would you go for the low price. Keep doing an awesome job guys. Regards, A delighted customer :)"
"I'm happy with my subscription overall and their regular additions are wonderful, including their exclusives which they funded to further our entertainment along with demonstrating streaming is effective as a business model. Although the UK Netflix is inferior to the USA's, I'm confident they'll only expand an already fine selection."
"My son started a Netflix account which I funded with my bank card. When we wanted to cancel, as you would expect   Netflix allow access to the account until the month you have paid for expires. But there is a catch. They keep your card details even when you have cancelled and there is no way to remove them online, you have to phone them. So I did this and they removed my bank details, but and this is where it gets nasty, when I went back to my account to watch a film I found that I was no longer allowed to use the remainder of the time which I had paid for... because I had removed my card details. Basically, they don‚Äôt make it easy to remove your private bank details and when you do, they turn nasty.I suggest cancelling an account, waiting for your month to expire and then phone them and get your bank details removed.UK number: 0800 096 6380"
"For the price per month this is a great service. The new original content is amazing and it has some great TV and films on there - although it would be great if they cut the lesser titles and did more frequent upadates. Only issue is that I wished that it had more of the content from the US version like Parks and Recs."
"Originally payed for the service so that my son could watch TV in his room from his xbox. App installed relatively simply and after initial problems getting it to work on the way the setup works in the parental control settings on the xbox, we were away.Now we all use netflix all the time because of the number of great films, documentaries and box sets on there. Sure there are things you'd like to see on there that aren't but the range of stuff to watch is so wide, you can always find something, and for the price of ¬£5.99 a month there's little to complain about.Overall, really impressed and would recommend it. We frequently due to 'conflicts of interest' are watching three different things on various devices or TV's."
"Netflix is one of the best online streaming companies I have come across. I have both the streaming plan and the DVD plan, and I have to say I have never been happier. I love the fact that I can catch up on seasons of my favorite TV shows with the streaming, and physical DVD's arrive at my door quickly. The only complaint I can think of is the fact that some movies aren't available for instant viewing fast enough. Also, the TV shows sometimes take a long time to make it to instant, when the season ends on traditional TV. All in all, Netflix is a great site for movie buffs or anyone that enjoys a great variety of movies and TV shows."
"I love using Netflix's service. I have both the streaming and DVD service, and both have been great. Though there's always a few movies or shows they don't have that I wish they did, or a show only available on DVD that I wish was streaming so I could watch it RIGHT NOW, ""this company doesn't spoil me ENOUGH"" is probably the most minor complain possible. This is the streaming service I use more than all others, and I doubt that will ever change."
"I thought it would have anything you can think of.  Almost every show I wanted to watch wasn't listed.  This service is probably great for most people's tastes."
"I'm totally a Nexflix addict. I literally LOVE it. The only thing I'd change is the software they use for streaming.. It sucks!!"
"I found netflix.com awesome! Lots of movies for free in one mounth and i had no problems :))"
"I enjoy Netflix, but it's so addictive! The feature where it starts the next episode after you just finished the last is useful. Especially when you need to study for that exam tomorrow. Overall, Netflix is a great service! I've had no problems. Well, except for a few D's and F's."
"When I initially signed up for Netflix, I was a bit skeptic, particularly about the service's ability to compete against the concentration of power in the media industry i.e. a handful of companies controlling content and resisting change. However, Netflix has won me over with its ability to strike good content deals, exclusives like Breaking Bad, and originals that are turning out to be better than anything seen in recent times. House Of Cards, in particular, is a great example of the future of television, which might as well be an obsolete term in a few years thanks to Netflix."
"Netflix is reasonably priced, but I wish they had a better streaming only content available. There have been many times I have looked for a movie to watch and it is not available for streaming.  They do have an awesome kids selection for streaming which is why they keep my business."
"Overall my experience has been average.  When I first opened my account I had issues with the media player - Silverlight.  After we got the bugs worked out it seems to be smooth sailing.  I just wish there were a larger variety of new releases.  I would also like to see if a TV serious is still on the air or if what is available is the entire show."
"Oh this place is the place to be if you want to spend hours of waiting or kill hours without having to go with the unbearable nothingness. They deliver excellent quality and now that they are in production with ""The House of Cards"" what is to stop them? These guys are awsome! Keep up the good work man!"
"Having used all of the main streaming services I have to admit this is the only one I am still paying for - rarely have problems watching movies, their auto-resume means I can watch a program/film and start in the same place when I start watching on another device.Would be nice if they could add more newer content - although I am sure i'd have to pay more then."
"IK wasn't a customer for long but that is because i thought it was restrictive. the brits don't get the same chaices as the americans which is a shame it would be alot better with a library like in America why is it that everyone see that the British should have to pay for half a service."
"Good selection of tv series. Okay selection of movies (Which gets tired very quickly). Selection could be improved. But if you only have freeview (UK), and dont want to fork out for additional cable, then ¬£6 for this is good value. Better than watching repeats on Dave."
"I took out the 30 day free trial. I didn't even use it once as there was absolutely nothing worth watching. 3 months later I found they had been taking money from my account with no notice and no reciepts. They refused to give me my money back saying nobody in the company had the authority to do that. This is a company that is not prepared to offer any customer service. If things go wrong or you are unhappy with the service there is absolutely no redress with Netflix. It is a company with no customer service, no professionalism and definitely NO ethics. Avoid at all costs."
"The only real problem I had was when I had it for 2 months and watched every Documentary (Lol), Shows and Movies I could watch on Amc or one of those type channels'. It almost seems like a Fox Movie Network on demand. Great if you don't have 500-600 channels on a dish/cable company. I will add, its killing our video/rental stores off. Slowly but surely everything will make it to the interwebs and we'll all be abel  to access it easier and easier. When that happens lets just trade our walking skills for sitting and we'll all be like the humans'  in Wall-e. That'll be the day. Sadly Netflix is going to rue the day over all the inferior video/video rental place AKA the dvd store. I think thats what the kid's are calling it these days...Right?"
"Series: If you enjoy tv-series it is definitely worth to try if you are a series freak: it is best for tv-series you can watch all the seasons in high quality. Never had a problem with streaming. Always smooth and if you pause it next day it will start again from where you were. Documentaries: it is quite ok with documentaries and ""docutainment"".Movies: not the latest, best or blockbusters movies. IF you are cinema lover, might be worth to try other services, I hope they'll improve the database.First trail month is free, a few euros a month (it is only offered in a few countries yet).  I had it for a 3 months than cancelled subscription"
"Don't get me wrong, I DO love Netflix but the site is not very blind friendly.  I typically enlarge webpages to make them more readable for me but with Netflix this is not possible without making portions of the site not work.  I think it would be great if they could add a ""no frills"", easy to use version for those with disabilities - i know I would appreciate it!"
"I love Netflix, it's very straight forward and easy to use. Clear payment terms and easy to cancel if you need too, unlike LoveFilm. Some people moan that the choice isn't that great but, it's only ¬£6 a month. That's great value if you only watch 4 or 5 films or shows a month."
"I've been a customer for several years. They are very reliable, I've rarely had streaming problems. Obviously the library is huge, there's no shortage of entertainment. And for $8 a month, it's an amazing value.While there are a lot of quality series and movies on here, my one wish is that there were more, and I would be more than willing to pay extra for it."
"It's the best support I have ever received from any company!"
"We liked Netflix at first-but geez, some of the movies we have to order and wait for are older and should be instant streaming! Great site if you are going back in time and catching all those mediocre movies you somehow missed, but really--it's so IRRITATING to get to the end of a TV series and still be 2-3 seasons behind. Seriously?! Get current, please-and your prices are going up, which is ridiculous. Get real or get out of the game is my advice. You started out great but now it's just so-so. Hulu beats you guys, hands down."
"out of all the streaming services netflix is the only one that can actually play a film without the buffer wheel. i would use again if i could afford it.  A lot of old stuff but do have new tv progs sometimes."
"They only have old movies and bad series. Sometime after I tried to contact them, but they only won't reply. After my trail, they took money for the next month, just three hours earlier that expected."
"I enjoy getting on Netflix now and then when I am looking to veg out in front of the TV. I don't rely on streaming for access to any of the latest movies, but every now and then I will see a series or, a movie that I haven't seen and I will sit down and watch it. For some of the harder to find shows the DVD service is wonderful, even though it can be a little difficult waiting for the DVDs to come in the mail."
"About a year ago we dumped the cable company and started using Netflix and Hulu plus for all of our television/movie watching.  The price for unlimited streaming is good, the service is pretty good as well (every once in a while we have a hard time with the system being down - but that is rare), and it is perfect for watching older television series from start to finish.  My biggest complaint is the lack of newer content (both films and relatively recent tv shows)."
"I would like to see instant service include dvd and blu ray extra features like making of and deleted scenes then we can do away with discs altogether. After all you main selling point is the alternative film viewing option from renting discs or buying them. Lets face it we get them for the extra features otherwise we would make the effort to see the film in the cinema. If this change is made then I really see Netflix becoming a household name for the future of home film entertainment provided they can increase new content volume and retain licenses.Oh yes for Japanese anime fans I am sure I am not  alone in wishing that Japanese audio option with English subtitles was made available. I know its a separate license but if its not possible then I will go back to buying dvds or waiting for box sets while streaming content from other websites."
"I've been a netflix subscriber until recently and I've found that the selection has become stale in the past year or so.Some of the newer streaming sites have managed to get current network TV content, mainstream movies and also manage to get new releases much more quickly. Unfortunately that is not the case with Netflix. If I want a new movie, I have to put it on my list to have it sent to me... I can't stream it. 'In addition, streaming on Netflix has been choppy recently. Many times, I've been disconnected from the service mid movie and had to restart. You might think be tempted to say ""Check your Internet Connection"".. but I've not had issues with other streaming services such as Hulu, Voodoo or internet streaming on my computer and Smart TV.Overall, I give it a 3 - because there are some shows I do enjoy such as a good 10 hour marathon session of law and order... but outside of older shows, there isn't much available.I hope this review helps Netflix get a better sense of what customers are looking for. The concept is good.. but without current and requested content... it's just a good concept gone wrong."
"Well... Netflix used to be great. That was back a few years ago. Nowadays with more (and cheaper) competition like Amazon Prime or iTunes ... it's pretty hard to justify shelling out $9 / month for their streaming service when they rarely update the content and their PS3 software is pretty poor, forgets passwords and crashes..."
"The service Netflix provide is great - the site is easy to navigate, the movies stream really fast and the price is great. The only downside is that the range of title available is pretty small. You can work through all the good stuff pretty quickly, unlike Lovefilm which has pretty much everything ever released. A lot of Netflix content are TV shows from Channel 4 (such as the Inbetweeners and Shameless) which are available to watch for free on Channel 4's steaming site, so not sure why you would need a paid for account on Netflix to watch them."
"As a person who relies on subtitles Netflix does have some subtitled movies unlike lovefilm.Only two stars because some of their tv series episodes are missing the subtitles ..I was mad as hell cos I actually paid for a month.Tv series was Roswell the last few eps of each season don't have subtitles! Not recommended if you rely on subtitles."
"I am currently on my free trial and because of our terrible tv reception I find Netflix very convenient to watch via my laptop.Some great series on it but my main criticism is the lack of newer releases. But see how it goes for the rest of my trial."
"I am okay happy with Netflix, it is easy works well on my Playstation 3, but the selection of movies is simply to old and to small.Which is a shame, because the service works very well."
"Yes it's only ¬£5.99 but if it's only got films that are generally over 10 years old or so bad they never got to the cinema... come on is it really worth it... Lovefilm much better"
"Its ok/good for tv series but still not upto date with them all and same with films not alot of the recent/modern ones..................But they say you get what you pay for, which it show not that much"
"Clean, pleasant web site, but most of us these days want to watch our Netflix through our TV.  Due to Netflix reliance on Microsoft Silverlight, virtually nothing except your computer will play it.  Support on all the common things like Plex, XBMC, Boxee etc just seems to be lacking.  So close and yet so far!"
"I've used Netflix mostly for the TV shows. I've watched a few Films using the service, not the best range but they are suitable for the price. I don't see a lot of new content appearing either. Use the free trial to see if the content is what you're looking for."
"Before they hiked up their prices, they were great. We had 1 DVD at a time with unlimited rentals and unlimited streaming for $10 per month and we were happy. Suddenly, it went up to $16 per month for this same service. We now only have the streaming. The streaming is nice and decently priced at $8 per month unlimited. It is very good for kids stuff, t.v. shows and documentaries but the movie selection is pretty limited."
"I good price for an on demand service. A reasonable selection of older content but probably too late to market to dislodge sky/ bbc iplayer and lovefilm. Hope it does well in the uk market as its a very well executed idea bit it is unfortunately too late for the uk market to make a big impact."
"love netflix the selection is good but could be better however i love the convenience and the price"
"I was initially skeptical about using Netflix,despite recommendations from friends and family. It was very easy to sign up and start my free 30 day trial.There are lots of choice in different categories,from cartoons and comedies to thrillers and everything in between. Placing movies in the queue is very easy and can be changed at any time.I no longer receive the DVDs in the post i stream via my PS3 and its great most things are in HD quality and for 5.99 a month its a bargain .Highly reccomend to any film / TV series fans 10/10 !!"
"There were NO movies that were on the 'available' lists of selections for our XBox 360 that interested myself or my children while we were paying for this service. My daughter could not even order ""Twilight"" or ""Eclipse"" even though the movies had been out for years with a message saying 'DVD' rental ONLY. Most of the selection seemed to come from 5 years or older or be straight to DVD releases. VERY VERY disappointed and feel ripped off, as I had high expectations for Netflix based on the commercials and what the website promised. NEVER AGAIN will I fall for such misleading advertising, and such a waste of money."
"I have been using Netflix for about a year, primarily using the streaming option with a Wii, and I have been thrilled. There are occasional service issues, but they do not impact viewing significantly. No more so than a commercial.My only real complaint has the been the user interface, which they changed in July. I switched to using Watch.io for browsing new titles, but still have the Netflix service and now I'm happy."
"We've been Netflix subscribers at my household for years now, and never have we been let down.  Even long before ""Watch Instantly"", a feature allowing you to view certain movies immediately at your computer or other home media device, Netflix was the greatest with an incredibly large selection of DVDs, delivered FAST to your door.One great thing about Netflix in the early days was the complete lack of LATE FEES, which no one had dared try before.  With Netflix, you can keep a DVD as long as you want.  The deal is, you can only keep a certain number of DVDs with you at once, so if you want to see more, you gotta send 'em back.However, since they added the Watch Instantly feature, Netflix has become even greater.  You can watch a good selection of movies and TV shows instantly on your computer or other web-enabled media device (like a PS3, Wii, or Apple TV).  The selection is limited to what the studios and copyright holders allow, but there is plenty to keep you entertained.Lately there has been a lot of negative talk about Netflix's rates increasing.  I don't want to go into this too much here, but the truth is that Netflix is being pressured by studios and copyright holders to pay them more money.  For Netflix to stay around, they have to charge more to keep up with greedy studio executives.  And even still, they're asking for the right to stream more and more movies through the Watch Instantly program.  Don't hate on Netflix for doing everything they can to try and help you have the best entertainment experience possible.And trust me, there's no better place to go for movies and TV than Netflix."
"We love netflix, it's so convenient, not having to drive to the video store, and the catalog is so much larger - every tiime we went to blockbuster, it takes 45 minutes of slowwwwly walkingggg arounnnnddd the place - but with Netflix we can easily choose all the favorites and create like a calendar of movies. And another pain with blockbuster was the merchandizing at the counter - geez they even sell those silly band things, 80 types of candy, t-shirts, breath mints...whatever they can make a buck on. This is not a rant against blockbuster, but I am really happy with netflix. thank you."
"Can not believe the sucess rate I have had with NETFLIX. For better than a year we have been receiving 1 to 3  DVD's  per week; exactly as promised.Had one bad DVD and they sent another the next day.Their catgories, ratings and Q  make the visit to the site a pleasure.This is  also a great place to use to research most (not all) movies."
"netflix rocks.  period"
